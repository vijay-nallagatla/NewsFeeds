			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2753955 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/mamata-759.jpg" alt="Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal assembly elections 2016, West bengal elections, WB polls, Election campaigns, Election campaigns in Kolkata, WB election campaign, EC, Election commission, india news," /> Banerjee had in 2014 reinstated some officers who had been removed by the EC during the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/">Lok Sabha</a> polls, after the poll process got over.
<p>Claiming that a section of police officials have &#8220;unleashed terror&#8221; on people at the behest of the Election Commission, Trinamool <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> supremo Mamata Banerjee on Sunday warned them of &#8220;consequences&#8221; if she is voted to power again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those responsible will have to face the consequences. Election Commission&#8217;s duty is to ensure free and fair poll, but they have unleashed terror with the help of a section of police officials,&#8221; Banerjee alleged, addressing an election rally here in Midnapore district.</p>

<p>Referring to officers who were appointed to important posts like that of Kolkata Police Commissioner and District Magistrates and SPs under instructions from the poll panel, the West Bengal Chief Minister said, &#8220;If someone thinks by getting power for 15 days, he will do anything, then he is mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Banerjee had in 2014 reinstated some officers who had been removed by the EC during the Lok Sabha polls, after the poll process got over.</p>
<p>Claiming she had got the &#8220;confirmation&#8221; about securing a majority in the Assembly polls, five phases of which are over, Banerjee said she had taken note of who had done what and also those who had worked &#8220;impartially&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough is enough. I am gentle to those who are good, but if anybody shows red eyes to me, then he will have to face the consequences,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In the fifth and penultimate phase of polling in 53 constituencies spread over south Kolkata, Hooghly and South 24 Parganas districts on Saturday, police personnel were said to have proactively controlled law and order situation in coordination with the central paramilitary forces.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has happened in these elections is unprecedented. I have seen elections since 1977 when I was a college student and have contested since 1984 Lok Sabha polls.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have never seen such activities taking place in the name of elections,&#8221; the TMC supremo said.</p>
<p>Alleging that local clubs and TMC offices had been locked by police and paramilitary forces, she said, &#8220;They were terrorising voters through the night using mikes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the chief minister of the state, even I could not sleep for two-three nights due to the police &#8216;tandav&#8217;. The paramilitary forces are being egged on by some coward police personnel,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;These coward policemen have worked at the behest of Congress, CPI(M) and <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a>,&#8221; Banerjee alleged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have kept record of everything, what each has done, whether good or bad. I will give appropriate answer for all the atrocities if I am alive,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Election, she said, is a festival of democracy, but they (EC) imposed section 144 (CrPC) and terrorised people as if curfew had been imposed, Banerjee said.</p>

<p>She alleged that CPI(M), Congress and BJP were controlling police stations and that a section of policemen were acting on &#8220;wild allegations&#8221; of the opposition parties.</p>
<p>Urging voters here in East Midnapore district, where elections are to be held on May five in the last phase, not to be afraid of central forces, she said &#8220;It is we (TMC) who will be there after a few days.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2779336&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kalvari, Indian Navy&#8217;s first indigenous Scorpene-class stealth submarine, on Sunday sailed out of Mumbai Harbour for sea trials even as the plan to purchase heavy-weight torpedos for the vessel remains stuck due to the VVIP chopper scam.</p>
<p>Kalvari is the first of the India&#8217;s six Scorpene-class submarines being built under the much-delayed Project 75. The vessels are being built by Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL) in collaboration with French company DCNS.</p>
<p>In October 2015, Kalvari had been set afloat. &#8220;The sea trials of Kalvari have begun today. It is a proud moment for us,&#8221; a Navy official said.</p>

<p>However, the plans to acquire heavy-weight torpedos for the submarine is stuck in the Defence Ministry even though the Navy had been pushing for it, citing national security imperatives.</p>
<p>WASS Italy, a Finmeccanica company, had emerged as a successful bidder in the procurement for the torpedos for Project 75 submarines.</p>
<p>Subsequently, because of the group&#8217;s alleged involvement in the VVIP helicopter case, the procurement was put on hold in July 2014.</p>
<p>Navy Chief Admiral R K Dhowan, while stressing on the importance of getting heavy-weight torpedos, had said that the Defence Ministry will take a final call on it.</p>

(Express Photo by Virender Singh Negi)
<p>Deposed Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat, who had so far been insisting the sting CD of him was &#8220;fake&#8221;, on Sunday virtually accepted his presence in the video.</p>
<p>He, however, said meeting a journalist was not a crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is meeting a journalist a crime? If one of the MLAs who had not been technically disqualified by that time talked to me &#8230; how does it matter? Do we block any channels in politics?&#8221; Rawat told reporters here on the sidelines of a programme.</p>
<p>Claiming innocence, Rawat said if the CD contained evidence of him having made an offer in cash or kind in exchange for the support of disgruntled MLAs he was ready to be hanged in public.</p>

<p>&#8220;If any evidence is found against me like me offering money or post to anybody, hang me at Clock tower,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Clock tower is a busy chowk in the heart of the town.</p>
<p>However, from what the deposed chief minister said it was clear that a meeting did take place between him and the journalist who made the sting CD.</p>
<p>It is significant as Rawat had so far been challenging the veracity of the CD, calling it &#8220;fake&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should anyone spend Rs 15 crore for me. The man (journalist) was saying something meaningless to while away my time and I said something to while away his. How does it matter? We keep saying things like this on a daily basis. Does that mean they should be used against us?&#8221; Rawat said.</p>
<p>The sting CD made by the editor-in-chief of a private news channel and circulated by the nine <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> rebels, who created a political crisis in the state by siding with opposition <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> in the state Assembly, purportedly shows Rawat negotiating a money deal with the journalist to buy the support of MLAs who had revolted against him.</p>

<p>The airports tariff regulator Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) had in February issued an order directing DIAL to discontinue DF from May 1, after having allowed it to levy DF through a December 2012 order.</p>
<p>Citing the average monthly collection of Rs 30 crore as DF, the AERA had in its order in February said the total sanctioned DF amount of Rs 3,415.35 crore was likely to be recovered by April 30, 2016. To cover the financial gap in developing the airport, the allowable DF was determined at Rs 3,415.35 crore.</p>
<p>Last month, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had also asked all airlines operating from Delhi to refund the development fee charged from passengers flying out of the IGI Airport on the tickets booked for journey beyond April 30.</p>

<p>A makeover for Air India&#8217;s cabin crew is in the offing soon with an internal committee, mostly comprising the in-flight staff, suggesting various sartorial options for draping themselves.</p>
<p>A 10-member committee, set up from within the ranks and headed by the General Manager for Cabin Crew, has suggested various options for patterns, material, texture and colours, among other things for the cabin crew uniform in its report, a senior Air India official said.</p>
<p>The options in the report are now being evaluated by the management before taking a final call on the issue, he said.</p>

<p>The cabin crew strength in Air India currently stands at around 4,000.</p>
<p>&#8220;The use of indigenous fabric &#8216;khadi&#8217; for draping the cabin crew is one of the several choices suggested by the committee,&#8221; the official said, not ruling out the possibility of the management looking at this option keeping in view the Prime Minister&#8217;s flagship project &#8216;Make in India&#8217;.</p>
<p>Significantly, the cabin crew operating Air India One, the official aircraft of the President, the Prime Minister and the Vice-President, during a recent official trip of Modi to Belgium and the US was all draped in khadi uniform.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was for the first time that such a committee was set up at the airline with all its members drawn from the cabin crew from across regional bases and also across fleets &#8212; wide-body and narrow-body. The idea was to give them a flexibility and freedom to chose the uniform they feel comfortable with,&#8221; the official said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Sampling of the clothing based on the committee&#8217;s suggestions is being carried out currently. Once this exercise is completed, the samples would be placed before the authorities concerned for a final view,&#8221; the official said.</p>
<p>The state-owned carrier had last April given a makeover to the cabin crew uniform.</p>
<p>At that time, while retaining the traditional saree as part of the uniform, it had introduced kurtis, churidars and trousers, besides Western style clothing to give a more contemporary look to its flight attendants.</p>
<p>Air India had the uniforms designed by the National Institute of Fashion Technology.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2779258&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The government will study the reasons behind such major fires and prepare an action plan accordingly, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The larger issue is why such fire occurs in the summer season. We will study the reasons and come out with an action plan on how to control it in future all over the country,&#8221; Javadekar said.</p>
<p>He said his ministry today began trial runs for a pre-fire alert system that will issue warnings via SMS about possible fire outbreaks in the country so that the forest department could attend to them immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are issuing fire alerts through satellite since last year. Wherever a fire breaks out in any remote forest, we get to know immediately. But these alerts are only issued after the fire has started,&#8221; Javadekar said.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a new technology developed by our forest institutes&#8230;It will generate pre-fire alerts. SMS will be sent to all departments and officers concerned so that action can be taken immediately,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2779248&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Keen to step up engagement in hydrocarbon sector with Iran, India has conveyed to the Persian Gulf nation that it was ready to clear nearly USD 6.5 billion of the dues for oil import from that country at the earliest, provided there was clarity on payment channel.</p>
<p>The message has been conveyed to Iran even as Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> is likely to visit the oil-rich country later this month.</p>

<p>Government sources said there has been a series of discussions at various levels both in Tehran and India and both sides were confident of resolving the issue soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working on clearing the dues to Iran and are hopeful that the issue will be resolved soon,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>Following lifting of sanctions against it in January under a historic nuclear deal, Iran had terminated a three-year-old system with India of getting paid for half of the oil dues in rupees and has been insisting on being paid in Euros for the oil it sells to Indian refiners.</p>
<p>It has also scrapped free delivery of crude oil to Indian refiners.</p>
<p>Officials said though Western sanctions against Iran were lifted, problems persist in banking channels due to which regular transactions were not possible yet.</p>
<p>Refiners like Essar Oil and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MPRL) owe nearly USD 6.5 billion in dues to Iran.</p>
<p>Since February 2013, Indian refiners like Essar Oil and MRPL paid 45 per cent of their import bill in rupees to UCO Bank account of Iranian oil company.</p>
<p>The remaining has been accumulating, pending finalisation of a payment mechanism.</p>
<p>Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and External Affairs Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sushma-swaraj-2/">Sushma Swaraj</a> had visited Iran last month during which they had conveyed to Iranian leaders that India wants to significantly ramp up engagement in oil and gas sector with that country.</p>
<p>The issue of the pending dues had also figured in the meetings.</p>
<p>Swaraj during her visit had conveyed to Iranian leadership that India wants to invest in joint ventures in oil and gas sectors in the Persian Gulf nation where foreign investors from major economic powers are rushing in to get early footholds after lifting of sanctions.</p>
<p>Following lifting of sanctions against Iran, India has been eying deeper energy ties with that country and has already lined up USD 20 billion as investment in oil and gas as well as petrochemical and fertiliser projects there.</p>
<p>New Delhi is looking to increase engagement with the sanction-free Iran by raising oil imports and possible shipments of natural gas. It also wants rights to develop Farzad-B gas field in the Persian Gulf discovered by OVL.</p>
<p>A deal for the field was not signed during Pradhan&#8217;s visit as Iranian Parliament, Majlis, is yet to approve the new Iran Petroleum Contract (IPC) under which the Farzad-B field is to be given to the OVL-led consortium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indian firms have so far shied away from investing in Iran for the fear of being sanctioned by the US and Europe.</p>
<p>The same was deterring New Delhi from claiming rights to invest nearly USD 7 billion in the biggest gas discovery ever made by an Indian firm abroad.</p>
<p>But after the lifting of sanctions, India is making a renewed pitch for rights to develop 12.8 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves OVL had found in 2008.</p>
<p>Pradhan also conveyed to the Iranian side that both countries must expand the basket of oil and gas trade.</p>
<p>He had also expressed India&#8217;s interest in importing LPG from Iran and said companies from both sides could discuss setting up of an extraction plant in Chabahar, if required.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s total crude import in 2015-16 was around 184 million tonnes.</p>

<p>Iran had in November 2013 offered free delivery of crude oil to Indian refiners as tough Western sanctions crippled its exports. With shipping lines refusing to transport Iranian crude for fear of being sanctioned, Iran used its shipping line for the delivery and did not charge for transportation</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2779243&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday launched a Rs 8,000 crore scheme to provide 5 crore free LPG connections to poor families as he attacked previous governments for just paying lip service to reducing poverty.</p>
<p>Calling himself &#8216;Shramik No.1&#8217; (Worker No.1), he listed out initiatives taken by his government for the welfare of labourers.</p>
<p>The launch coincided with May Day and Modi attacked previous governments for doing little for the poor. &#8220;Policies made by previous governments were not keeping in mind the welfare of poor but only ballot boxes,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Poverty, he said, can be eradicated only if poor are empowered, given resources and opportunities as well as education, jobs, houses, drinking water and electricity.</p>
<p>He questioned the policies pursued by the previous government for poverty eradication, saying poverty has only increased during past years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working to fight poverty,&#8221; he said, adding that under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, free LPG connections will be provided in name of women members of BPL households.</p>
<p>In the first year, 1.5 crore such connections will be released and the target of 5 crore will be completed in three years, he said, comparing it to the just 13 crore LPG connections provided in 60 years of independence.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my first speech in Central Hall of Parliament after <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> government came to power (in 2014), I had said my government is dedicated to poor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever this government does will be for the benefit of the poor and for the welfare of poor,&#8221; he said as he listed out various labour-friendly initiatives, including raising minimum pension to Rs 1,000 and introduction of labour identification number (LIN).</p>
<p>Also, the maximum wage that entitles bonus to workers has been raised to Rs 21,000 from Rs 10,000 per month previously, while the bonus limit too has been doubled to Rs 7,000.</p>
<p>Provident fund (PF) portability has been provided to help utilise the Rs 27,000 crore of retirement benefits lying unused because of workers changing jobs or cities.</p>
<p>On March 27, Modi had officially launched the &#8216;Give-it-Up&#8217; campaign, urging the well-off to surrender their LPG subsidy so that it can be given to the needy. The aim is also to bring down the country&#8217;s dependence on energy imports by 10 per cent by 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;Responding to the call, 1.10 crore people have given up their subsidies,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Subsidy surrendered will be used to provide free LPG connection to BPL families.</p>
<p>Consumers are currently entitled to 12 cylinders of 14.2 kg each or 34 bottles of 5 kg each in a year at subsidised<br />
rates. A subsidised 14.2-kg cylinder is currently available at Rs 419.15 per bottle in Delhi while the 5-kg pack costs Rs 155.</p>
<p>Market-priced LPG is available at Rs 509.50 per 14.2-kg cylinder. Giving up subsidised LPG will help cut the government&#8217;s subsidy bill, which was at Rs 30,000 crore for the fuel last fiscal.</p>
<p>Nearly Rs 5,000 crore of subsidy saved through the campaign is being used to provide LPG connection to the poor.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have released 60 lakh new connection to poor in the last one year,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Under the scheme launched today, a financial support of Rs 1,600 for each LPG connection will be provided to the BPL households. The identification of eligible BPL families will be made in consultation with the state governments and the Union Territories.</p>
<p>The country currently has 16.64 crore active LPG consumers. Stating that LPG coverage is being increased, he said<br />
there are serious health hazards associated with cooking based on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>According to WHO estimates, about 5 lakh deaths occur in India alone due to unclean cooking fuels. Experts say having an open fire in the kitchen is like burning 400 cigarettes an hour.</p>
<p>Providing LPG connections to BPL households will ensure universal coverage of cooking gas in the country and this will empower women and protect their health, he said.</p>
<p>Finance Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/arun-jaitley/">Arun Jaitley</a> had in his Budget for 2016-17 provided Rs 2,000 crore to provide deposit free LPG connections to 1.5 crore women belonging to BPL families.</p>
<p>Further, the Budget announced that the scheme will be continued for two more years to cover 5 crore households.</p>
<p>Modi said he had last year pledged to electrify 18,000 villages where even an electricity pole has not reached so far, in next 1,000 days.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>
[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
<p>Uttar Pradesh, he said, has given many Prime Ministers to the country and he was fortunate that the state has accepted him.</p>
<p>The state had 1,529 villages where even electricity poles had not reached. In 250 days since the scheme was launched, 1,326 villages have been electrified and power supply started, he said adding the remaining villages would be covered soon.</p>
<p>He asked people to pledge not to pollute river Ganga to protect the environment and heritage.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2779235&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Earlier on Saturday, Nitish Kumar government in Bihar rolled out the red carpet for Kanhaiya who is on his first visit to his home state after release from jail on charge of sedition.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2779230&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

(PTI photo)
<p>JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar on Sunday was shown black flags at a function in Patna by two unidentified persons who were roughed up by his supporters before being detained by the police for questioning.</p>
<p>The two persons belonging to a little-known outfit -&#8216;Youth Swaraj&#8217; &#8211; showed black flags to the JNUSU president, besides raising slogan of &#8216;Bharat Mata Ki Jai&#8217; while he was speaking at a function &#8216;Azadi&#8217; in S K Memorial hall organised by AISF and AIYF.</p>
<p>Kanhaiya&#8217;s supporters thrashed the two persons in the hall. Later the police took the duo into custody.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>— ANI (@ANI_news) <a href="http://twitter.com/ANI_news/status/726681102849478656">May 1, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Police have detained two persons in this regard,&#8221; Patna Senior Superintendent of Police Manu Maharaj told PTI.</p>
<p>The two detainees have been identified as Nitish Kumar, a resident of Sitamarhi district, and Manikant Mani, a resident of Samastipur district, the police said, adding that the two youths are said to be the members of RSS.</p>
<p>The JNUSU president, who was addressing the gathering when the incident occurred, said he was not scared of such elements who oppose him or try to distub his functions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not scared of anything whether you hurl a shoe or a stone&#8230;. They want to disturb my programmes as they are uncomfortable with my questions,&#8221; Kumar said.</p>
<p>Attacking Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a>, Kumar alleged that he became the PM &#8220;with the support of capitalists&#8221; and cannot solve the problem of unemployment.</p>
<p>Criticizing those who say that tax-payers&#8217; money or subsidy being provided to the JNU is a waste of public money, Kumar said that there is a &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; to &#8220;defame&#8221; the premier academic institution of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a PhD scholar who is the son of an Anganwadi worker. This itself proves that taxpayers&#8217; money or subsidy given to JNU is spent and utilised properly,&#8221; Kumar said, adding that people should not worry about wastage of taxpayers&#8217; money as a large majority of people in the country want JNU like institutions.</p>
<p>Alleging that only capitalists get loans from banks, he said they &#8220;do not repay loans and instead they fly to London overnight&#8221;, a reference to the fugitive industrialist Vijay Mallya, who is in Britain after defaulting on a loan of over Rs 9000 crore.</p>
<p>Kumar was given a rousing welcome in the state yesterday. He was escorted by a posse of policemen at airport on his arrival from New Delhi and the JNUSU President moved with a convoy in the state capital.</p>
<p>Kanhaiya, who hails from Begusarai district of Bihar, is on a two-day tour of his home state and met both Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav on Saturday.</p>

<p>Amid the raging row over Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#8217;s educational qualification, the Gujarat University on Sunday shared details of his MA degree saying he scored 62.3 per cent as an external student of the varsity.</p>
<p>The details were shared by the Gujarat University after the Central Information Commission directed it to provide the same to Delhi Chief Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/arvind-kejriwal/">Arvind Kejriwal</a>, who had recently criticised the functioning of the transparency panel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Narendra Damodardas Modi passed his MA in Political Science in 1983 with first class, securing 499 out of 800 marks, which comes to 62.3 per cent as an external student,&#8221; Gujarat University&#8217;s Vice Chancellor M N Patel told PTI on Sunday.</p>
<p>Kejriwal, in a letter to CIC in response to an RTI application seeking details of his electoral photo identity card (EPIC), demanded that while he was ready to share information sought by RTI applicants, the CIC must also order disclosure of educational qualifications of the PM.</p>

<p>After Kejriwal&#8217;s letter, the CIC had on Friday ordered Delhi University, from where he pursued his Bachelor of Arts (BA) course, and Gujarat University, from where he completed his MA, to reveal details of his education qualifications.</p>
<p>Vice Chancellor Patel said he has not received any order of CIC till now, but he came to know about it from media, and will give the details to concerned applicants if he receives the order.</p>
<p>&#8220;The details (of Modi&#8217;s degree) were sought through several Right to Information (RTI) applications filed before the university, but we were not in a position to share the details under the RTI Act on technical grounds,&#8221; Patel said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The details of marks can only be provided to the candidate himself, and we do not provide details of university records beyond 20 years,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When asked about the details of Modi&#8217;s BA degree, Patel said they do not have it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Modi did his MA as an external candidate. He secured 237 out of 400 marks in MA first year, and 262 out of 400 marks in MA second year,&#8221; Patel said giving the details.</p>
<p>&#8220;The breakup of marks in second year MA shows that Modi obtained 64 marks in political science, 62 marks in European and social political thoughts, 69 marks in modern India/political analysis, and 67 marks in political psychology,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2194899 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/10/ec759.jpg" alt="Election Commission" /> The report on Demands for Grants (2016-17) of the Law Ministry tabled in Parliament on Friday said, as of now, the EC and State Election Commissions have separate electoral rolls.
<p>From panchayat elections to <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/">Lok Sabha</a> polls, there should be a common electoral roll, a Parliamentary committee has recommended, saying it will help weed out duplicate voters and bring down cost of holding the democratic exercise.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Committee feels that a common electoral roll will reduce cost, time, and check electoral malpractices in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Committee, therefore, recommends that a common electoral roll be prepared in the country which can be used from panchayat level to Parliamentary elections by the State Election Commissions to weed out multiple electoral rolls to check corrupt practices during elections,&#8221; the Standing Committee on Law and Personnel said in its latest report.</p>

<p>The report on Demands for Grants (2016-17) of the Law Ministry tabled in Parliament on Friday said, as of now, the EC and State Election Commissions have separate electoral rolls.</p>
<p>&#8220;They carry out registration of voters and updating of electoral rolls separately. The numbers of voters in their electoral rolls usually vary,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>While EC is entrusted with the task of holding Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, the State Election Commissions supervise elections to local bodies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it was the Commission which had earlier raised the issue to have common electoral rolls.</p>
<p>In a letter written to then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in November, 1999, the Election Commission had said that separate rolls prepared by the EC and State ECs &#8220;not only create confusion among the electors because their names may be present in one roll but absent in the other, or vice versa, but also result in duplication of effort and expenditure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EC had said that in almost all the cases, the same machinery at the field level is entrusted the job of preparing and revising rolls for both types of elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The electoral rolls for Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies are prepared and revised under the strict superintendence, direction and control of the Election Commission, with due care and caution and by incurring considerable expenditure,&#8221; the poll watchdog had told Vajpayee.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>
[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
<p>The EC had maintained that a single electoral roll &#8220;will be a huge national saving&#8221; and it will not pose any problems<br />
to the electoral machinery on the field as it is the same at the ground level.</p>
<p>&#8220;This may need some minor amendments to the local laws of the states concerned, but will subserve great national interest of economy in government expenditure on elections,&#8221; the EC had said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2779127&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an apparent dig at the erstwhile <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a>-led governments, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said most policies had been made in the past keeping the ballot box in mind and not for development or alleviation of poverty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our government has been working for the uplift of the poverty-stricken people&#8230; through &#8216;jan bhagidari&#8217; (people&#8217;s participation). Many policies had been made keeping in mind the ballot box and not the real interests of the vast majority of the poor people of our country,&#8221; he said at a public meeting.</p>
<p>He also launched the &#8216;PM Ujjwala Yojana&#8217; scheme which aims at providing 5 crore free cooking (LPG) connections to below-poverty-line families over the next three years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uttar Pradesh has given so many Prime Ministers. But why did the poverty levels go on increasing? Were there some drawbacks in these policies?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This land of Ballia is a revolutionary land. This land gave us Mangal Pandey. People from here give their lives to the nation: PM</p>
<p>— PMO India (@PMOIndia) <a href="http://twitter.com/PMOIndia/status/726664437206241280">May 1, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p>He said an MP from Ghazipur in UP when Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime Minister had raised the issue of abject poverty in eastern UP following which a commission was formed which made several major recommendations.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to those recommendations, only God knows. Fifty years have passed since then. One of the recommendations was to connect Ghazipur and Mau by rail. We have now decided to construct a rail line to implement that recommendation,&#8221; Modi said.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also spoke on the significance of May Day today and said the new &#8216;Mantra&#8217; should be &#8212; &#8220;Labourers, unite the world&#8221; as against &#8220;Workers of the World, Unite&#8221;, the slogan which used to be raised earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;The situation has changed. The biggest cementing factor is the sweat of the workers who can unite the world,&#8221; he said, noting that those who used to raise slogans of uniting the workers have been &#8220;losing ground the world over&#8221;.</p>

<p>A Mi 17 chopper of the IAF began water sprinkling operations in Nainital Sunday to control raging forest fires which have destroyed 2269 hectares of forested area across Uttarakhand, even as another chopper engaged for the same mission failed to take off due to low visibility.</p>
<p>The chopper, which has the capacity of carrying 3000 litres of water, is collecting water from Bhimtal lake and making sorties of Almakhan, Kilbari and Nalena areas of the district to douse the fires, Principal Conservator of Forest and nodal officer BP Gupta told.</p>
<p>However, another IAF chopper engaged for the same purpose in Pauri has not been able to take off due to low visibility, Pauri District Magistrate Chandrasekhar Bhatt said.</p>

<p>Seven persons have been killed due to forest fires, which have spread to sparsely populated remote hill areas.</p>
<p>Pauri, Nainital, Rudraprayag and Tehri are among the worst hit districts, Gupta said but hoped with all agencies activated the situation was bound to improve.</p>
<p>Three companies of the NDRF, one of SDRF besides PRD and homeguard personnel are currently engaged in the operations, he said.</p>
<p>With the MeT department predicting a significant fall in day temperatures after May 2, forest fires may get under control after a couple of days, he said but added that the administration will have to remain alert for the next 35 days to prevent fresh forest fire incidents.</p>

<p>Worried over forest fires which are still raging in different parts of the state, Governor K K Paul had reviewed the rescue efforts underway via videoconferencing with officials in the field and asked them to speed up their efforts.</p>
<p>IG Sanjay Gunjyal is coordinating with the NDRF, the district magistrates concerned and Principal Conservator of Forest to supervise the rescue operations.</p>
<p>Locals are being encouraged to report a fire incident to the district magistrate concerned as soon as they sight it so that it can be controlled in time.</p>
<p>The governor haD doubled the number of personnel deployed to control the fires from 3000 to 6000 and asked all agencies including the SDRF, district administration and the rural population to contribute their bit in the exercise.</p>
<p>Forest fires are natural during summer but this time they have occurred on a bigger scale as the fire season which normally begins by February 15 and ends by June 15, began on February 2.</p>
<p>Former chief minister Harish Rawat has asked the governor to declare Uttarakhand as a fire disaster struck state and involve locals as much as possible in fire extinguishing efforts.</p>

<p>The PCF said the scale of forest fires in Uttarakhand this time has been bigger due to little or no rain during winter at most places.</p>
<p>Pre-fire alerts listing possible fire points over the next seven days in forest areas are being made available on forest department&#8217;s website <a href="http://www.forest.uk.govt" rel="nofollow">http://www.forest.uk.govt</a>. an official release here said.</p>
<p>The Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is rushing Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) refullers to replenish IAF choppers deployed to douse the massive fire in Uttarakhand.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2779081&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earlier Sunday morning, the Prime Minister reached the Babatpur airport. He was received, among others, by Governor Ram Naik and state minister Brahma Shankar Tripathi.</p>
<p>From the airport, Modi took off in a helicopter for Ballia.</p>
<p>He is expected to return to Varanasi in the afternoon and spend close to six hours in the city during which he will preside over a function where e-rickshaws will be distributed among hundreds of beneficiaries.</p>
<p>At the Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW) premises, where the function will be held, Modi is also likely to interact with distinguished persons hailing from the city, including artists, educationists, jurists and those running Self-Help Groups.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will then pay a visit to &#8216;Jnana Pravah&#8217; –- a centre for cultural studies -– where he is to meet city-girl Soni Chaurasia who recently set a world record by giving a non-stop 126-hour Kathak dance performance.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will then leave for the Assi Ghat, where he will launch 11 solar-powered boats.</p>
<p>Modi has been calling for cleaning up the Ganga ever since he got elected from Varanasi in May, 2014 general elections.</p>
<p>The solar-powered boats, which are also referred to as e-boats or eco-boats, are aimed at reducing the alarming pollution levels in the holy river.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2779062&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The supporters of separate Vidarbha led by its strong protagonist, former Maharashtra Advocate General Shreehari Aney, Sunday hoisted a &#8216;Vidarbha flag&#8217; in Nagpur and said they would intensify their movement for statehood to the region.</p>
<p>A number of pro-Vidarbha leaders and activists gathered at a private resort in Bajaj Nagar Square in Nagpur and hoisted the specially prepared multi-colour flag as a mark of protest against the merger of the then Vidarbha, the Central Provinces and Berar into Maharashtra on May 1, 1960.</p>
<p>They also chanted pro-Vidarbha slogans.</p>
<p>Similar flags were also unfurled at about 24 other places across the Vidarbha region.</p>

<p>On the occasion, Aney, whose remarks on separate Marathwada and Vidarbha recently sparked controversy leading to his resignation from AG&#8217;s post, said the flag of separate Vidarbha is being raised on May 1 for last three years.</p>
<p>He said this year the movement for separate Vidarbha state has gained momentum since it has been strongly opposed by the ruling alliance partner Shiv Sena, besides MNS.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not apprehensive of any political party or group which is opposing the creation of Vidarbha state, but our fight will go on and it will be further intensified from day one of the commencement of winter session of state Legislature here in the second capital (of Maharashtra) in December,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Till December, we are chalking out strategy to agitate for carving out Vidarbha from Maharashtra,&#8221; Aney said.</p>
<p>He declined to comment on alleged remarks by Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray against him and said, &#8220;Come what may we will maintain our discipline and decency in agitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prominent members of pro-Vidarbha organisations, Vidarbha Economic Development Council (VED), Shetkari Sanghatana, Vidarbha Vikas Aghadi and other outfits also participated.</p>
<p>Former three-term MLA, Shetkari Sanghatana&#8217;s Wamanrao Chatap, former Minister of State and Dalit leader Sulekha Kumbhare, ex-Director General of Police Prabir Chakraborty, former Chief Commissioner of Income Tax B Dharmik, Jan Manch president advocate Anil Killor, former Vice Chancellor of Nagour University Haribhau Kedar were among those present on the occasion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the local Shiv Sena unit protested the movement for separate state and unfurling of the &#8216;Vidarbha flag&#8217; by Aney.</p>
<p>The Shiv Sainiks, led by district president Satish Harde, gathered at HB Town in eastern part of city, raised pro-Maharashtra slogans and allegedly burnt an effigy of Aney.</p>
<p>The MNS, which is also opposed to creation of Vidarbha, organised a Maharashtra flag hoisting event adjacent to the Aney&#8217;s programme at Bajaj Nagar Square.</p>
<p>In another development, four activists of Aam Aadmi party, which has extended support to Vidarbha state, climbed an 80-feet mobile tower of a private telecom company at Akashwani Square in favour of the separate statehood demand.</p>
<p>Sporting white caps with pro-Vidarbha state slogans painted on it, the youths wanted to draw the attention of political leadership over demand for Vidarbha.</p>
<p>However, no untoward incident was reported from any part of city in view of the events in support of and against the Vidarbha statehood issue.</p>

<p>The issue of Kohinoor diamond has been in news for the last few days. In response to a Public Interest Litigation being heard by the apex court, the government had on April 18 said the diamond estimated to cost over USD 200 million was neither stolen nor &#8220;forcibly&#8221; taken by British rulers but gifted to the East India Company by erstwhile rulers of Punjab 167 years back.</p>
<p>However, the next day, it had said all efforts will be made to get it back.</p>
<p>Kohinoor, which means mountain of light, is a large, colourless diamond that was found in southern India in early 14th century. The 108-carat gem, which came into British hands during the colonial era, is the subject of a historic ownership dispute and has been claimed by at least four countries including India.</p>
<p>Earlier responding to another RTI application, the ASI had said under the provisions of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, India takes up the issue of retrieval of only such antiquities as have been illegally exported out of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the object referred by you (Kohinoor) has been taken out of the country prior to the Independence, the Archaeological Survey of India is not in a position to process the matter,&#8221; it had said.</p>
<p>To a question seeking details of items which are in the UK&#8217;s custody and India wants to claim them back, the ASI, which functions under the Culture Ministry said: &#8220;There is no list available with the Archaeological Survey of India about the items in Britain&#8217;s custody&#8221;.</p>
<p>The apex court is hearing the PIL filed by All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front seeking directions to the High Commissioner of United Kingdom for return of the diamond besides several other treasures.</p>
<p>The PIL has made Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Culture, High Commissioners of the UK, Pakistan and Bangladesh as parties to the case. It has also sought return of the ring and sword of Tipu Sultan and other treasures of him besides Bahadur Shah Zafar, the Queen of Jhansi, Nawab Mir Ahmad Ali Banda and other rulers of India.</p>

<p>Making an all out effort to enhance the green cover along the tracks, Indian Railway has firmed up an ambitious proposal to plant 5 crore saplings ahead of the onset of monsoon on land owned by it.</p>
<p>We will undertake a massive tree plantation drive on rail land across the country before the onset of monsoon, said a senior official in the Environment Directorate of Railway Ministry.</p>
<p>Railways has created a separate directorate to carry out environment-related activities in a focused manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are finalising the varieties of trees such as neem, pilkhan, jamun to be planted on rail land including on both sides of the tracks. The saplings will be region-specific and vary from zone to zone,&#8221; said the official.</p>

<p>He said it would be ensured that branches of the trees do not block the tracks.</p>
<p>Railways will be joined by Environment Ministry and state governments in the green drive.</p>
<p>We will sign an MoU with the Environment Ministry to carry out the plantation exercise, he said.</p>
<p>Besides, railways will also rope in NGOs in the country-wide exercise. There are many NGOs which are involved in social forestry and their services will be enlisted by the public transporter.</p>
<p>Our aim is to go ahead with the plantation at a fast pace before the monsoon so that rain will allow the saplings to grow quickly, he said.</p>
<p>The land where trees will be planted will remain with railways while the maintenance of trees will be a joint effort of railways, Environment Ministry and state governments.</p>
<p>The official said the tree plantation drive will serve dual purpose. &#8220;While the plantation is an environment-friendly exercise, trees will also prevent encroachment of rail land.&#8221;</p>
<p>The public sector behemoth has launched a string of green initiatives in the recent past including water conservation, generating solar and wind power and using LED bulbs among others.</p>
<p>The railways is setting up automatic coach washing plants all rail depots to minimise the use of water for cleaning trains.</p>
<p>In the wake of water scarcity being faced be several states, railways has already launched a drive to protect and revive all water bodies on land owned by it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2759588 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/tiger1.jpg" alt="tiger, tiger safari, madhya pradesh, pench national park, mowgli home, tigers in pench, national tiger conservation authority, wildlife activists, India news" /> Madhya Pradesh ranks third &#8212; after Karnataka and Uttarakhand &#8212; in tiger population in the country
<p>Madhya Pradesh forest department is considering a proposal to fell over 550 trees to make way for a tiger safari in its Pench national park, known as home to &#8216;Mowgli&#8217;, a fictional character and protagonist in English writer Rudyard Kipling&#8217;s &#8216;The Jungle Book&#8217;.</p>
<p>The forest department has started working on a project to create tiger safari in the park straddling Seoni and Chhindwara districts of the state. It has been proposed to erect a boundary wall which would require pruning of shrubs and felling of 556 trees, according to an order issued by Pench national park&#8217;s authorities.</p>
<p>However, the plan has got stuck for want of permission of Delhi-based National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). The decision to cut 556 trees has, however, been criticised by wildlife activists who termed it as a violation of rules.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are against the creation of tiger safari inside Pench national park. There has been continuous cases of tiger deaths in Madhya Pradesh. The state government instead of taking steps towards protection of tigers is trying to reduce the green cover and increasing people&#8217;s activities. The NTCA must reject this plan,&#8221; said Ajay Dubey, on whose petition Supreme Court had in 2010 banned tourism inside tiger reserves.</p>
<p>Pench national park or tiger reserve is known world over as home to &#8216;Mowgli&#8217;&#8211; a man-cub said to have been spotted there. The park, sprawling over 758 square kms, is located on the southern boundary of Madhya Pradesh, bordering Maharashtra.</p>
<p>It has 299 sq kms core area of Indira Priyadarshini Pench national park and the Mowgli Pench Sanctuary. The remaining 464 sq km is the buffer area.</p>
<p>There are six tiger reserves in Madhya Pradesh&#8211;Kanha, Bandhavgarh, Panna, Bori-Satpura, Sanjay-Dubri and Pench &#8212; which have about 257 big cats. While the tiger population in the country was estimated at 1,706 in 2010, it had risen to 2,226 in 2014.</p>
<p>Madhya Pradesh ranks third &#8212; after Karnataka and Uttarakhand &#8212; in tiger population in the country.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778849&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Underworld don Chhota Rajan, deported to India after being caught from Bali in Indonesia in October last year, continues to face death threat even inside the high security Tihar jail where he has been lodged, Delhi Police sources said.</p>
<p>They said an SMS was purportedly sent from the cell phone of Chhota Shakeel, a close aide of fugutive mob boss <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/dawood-ibrahim/">Dawood Ibrahim</a>, to a senior Tihar jail official threatening to eliminate Chhota Rajan, prompting the senior officer to seek additional security for him.</p>
<p>The SMS was sent from mobile number 971504265138 to the cell phone of Tihar Law Officer Sunil Gupta, threatening &#8216;The End&#8217; of Chhota Rajan very soon, sources said. A call had also been received on Tihar&#8217;s landline number following the SMS after which Rajan&#8217;s security has been enhanced.</p>

<p>The police has also been informed about the threat call.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long will you save this dead pig from death, very soon I will do his the end,&#8221; the message by &#8220;Haji Chhota Shakeel&#8221; said.</p>
<p>A Special Cell officer confirmed the receipt of the message by the Tihar official without disclosing anything else.</p>
<p>Gupta had received the SMS in the morning of November 24 last year after which he brought the matter into the knowledge of higher ups and sought security for himself and his family, sources said. The matter is now being investigated by police.</p>
<p>After being on the run for 27 years, Chhota Rajan was arrested in Bali (Indonesia) on October 25 on a Red Corner notice of Interpol.</p>
<p>He was deported and brought to India on November 6 for facing trial in various criminal cases registered against him in Delhi and Mumbai.</p>
<p>In New Delhi he was sent to 14-day judicial custody by a local court and lodged in the high-security Tihar jail on November 19.</p>
<p>Rajan, once a Dawood Ibrahim confidante, has been brought to the country to face trial in over 70 cases of murder, extortion and drug smuggling.</p>
<p>Ever since his arrival, Rajan has been questioned by various investigating agencies. He has been making claims of having further evidence to nail India&#8217;s most wanted terrorist Dawood Ibrahim and his links with Pakistan&#8217;s external snooping agency ISI.</p>

<p>He went on to add that the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a>-led UPA government had to answer on its inaction against the AgustaWestland deal. “The company was banned during our government, not theirs (UPA). First, let them show any action that they have taken against the company or if they have ordered for its blacklist,&#8221; Parrikar said.</p>
<p>On the report that will be tabled before Parliament, Parrikar suggested that those involved in the AgustaWestland deal had tried to erase their trail of corruption. &#8220;It is for us (government) to prove and prosecute them&#8230; for those who have received kickbacks will not leave behind any proof or evidence (of corruption)&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>A minor girl has moved the Delhi High Court seeking cancellation of bail of her husband, who had allegedly sexually abused her and later married her to secure bail in the case lodged against him.</p>
<p>The petition has challenged the trial court&#8217;s December last year order which had declined to entertain her plea to cancel the bail of her husband on the ground that &#8220;the child victim can take an appropriate remedy with regard to her allegation as per matrimonial laws&#8221;.</p>
<p>The accused is facing trial under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), house trespass and hurting the girl while allegedly sexually abusing her.</p>

<p>As per the petition, the accused had sexually assaulted the victim, who was then 15-year-old, on various occasions since March 2014 till August 2014.</p>
<p>On her complaint the boy was arrested and granted interim bail on September 15, 2014 to marry the girl. Later he was granted regular bail on September 27, 2014.</p>
<p>The couple got married on getting interim bail, but she was turned out of her matrimonial house after her testimony in the case was recorded in April 2015 in his favour.</p>
<p>She, in her plea filed through advocate A P Singh, alleged that after securing bail, the accused and his family members started harassing her &#8220;physical and mentally&#8221; and demanded dowry.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s mother in her petition also alleged that she and her family members were threatened by the accused that if they do not withdraw the case, they will face &#8220;consequences&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trial court judge has endorsed the marriage of minor child victim, which is not valid under law,&#8221; the plea said, adding that the &#8220;trial court&#8217;s order should be set aside&#8221;.</p>
<p>The plea said the girl has &#8220;no intention to compromise in the case with the accused as he made false assurance to the court to get regular bail.</p>

<p>The National Green Tribunal has taken strong objection to high tension cables encircling around trees and directed power distribution companies in the national capital to remove these wires expeditiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited, BSES Rajdhani Power Limited and BSES Yamuna Power Limited shall continue to remain obliged to remove wires twined around the trees or any part of it within their licensed areas falling in NCT Delhi and such work shall be completed within next 20 weeks,&#8221; a bench headed by Justice U D Salvi said.</p>
<p>The green panel also directed these companies to cooperate with civic authorities concerned in trimming the branches of trees which touch the overhead wires.</p>

<p>On March 23, the tribunal had slammed discoms for putting high tension cables on trees, with the green panel warning of action against their top bosses if the wires were not removed.</p>
<p>It had also directed all municipal corporations and departments concerned to file their compliance reports regarding deconcretisation of trees within two weeks.</p>
<p>The NGT had last year issued notices to Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board, BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd, BSES Yamuna Power Ltd and North Delhi Power Ltd for choking trees by putting wires around them.</p>
<p>In 2013, it had directed public authorities, including municipal bodies and Delhi Development Authority to ensure that sign boards, advertisements, wires and other objects that deface trees as well as concrete around them in the national capital are removed forthwith.</p>
<p>The bench was hearing a petition filed by advocate Aditya N Prasad alleging that concretisation of trees in various parts of Delhi was leading to weakening of the roots and eventually their death.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778706&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8220;Good health is a justiciable fundamental right&#8221;, a Delhi court has said while observing that Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#8217;s ambitious project for health insurance cover for everyone would bring about an &#8216;evolution&#8217; in India&#8217;s health insurance model.</p>
<p>The court&#8217;s observations came while pulling up the United India Insurance Company Ltd, a Public Sector Unit (PSU), for rejecting the mediclaim of a person for heart ailment on the ground of genetic disease exclusion clause.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hold that a genetic disease exclusion clause in a mediclaim insurance policy which is a contract between the insurer and the insured and which totally excludes the grant of insurance in case of genetic diseases, is liable to be struck down being violative of the constitutional mandate, the fundamental underlying constitutional scheme, policy of the State and public good.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such clauses are arbitrary, discriminatory and unfair as they discriminate persons suffering from genetic disorders/ diseases from state assistance,&#8221; Additional District Judge Kamini Lau said.</p>
<p>The court said, &#8220;The ambitious project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi i.e. National Health Assurance Mission (NHAM) envisioning a scheme for health insurance cover for everyone is yet to effectively put in place and rolled out before it can be offered to everyone and this would bring about an evolution of the health insurance model in India as promised.&#8221;</p>
<p>The court, while deciding the suit against the insurance firm, said plaintiff Jai Prakash Tayal was entitled to recover from the company Rs five lakh which he had spent for his treatment at the hospital.</p>
<p>The firm had denied mediclaim saying &#8220;genetic disease is not payable as per policy genetic exclusion clauses&#8221;.</p>
<p>The man had told the court that he has already taken two claims for the same treatment and therefore, a third claim for the same disease was not liable to be rejected.</p>
<p>The court observed that a person suffering from a genetic disease, is as much in need of a medical insurance cover as others and the liability qua them is more.</p>
<p>The court said, &#8220;No person can be discriminated or deprived of a State protection in case of an ailment, be it genetic or acquired&#8230;.the courts of law are required to interpret the provisions of the private contracts in the light of these constitutional obligations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The judge added that any failure on the part of service provider/ insurer would be a violation of the existing law and the repeated directions of the Supreme Court for which the<br />
regulatory authority i.e. IRDA would be obligated to intervene to ensure that needful is done by the service provider.</p>
<p>The court also said that a human society must be able to provide basic health access to its citizens irrespective of their paying capacity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I may observe that good health is not a privilege but a justiciable fundamental right&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;However, in our country the health care finances have a poor record and only four per cent of the national budget spent on health.</p>
<p>&#8220;An alternative which has largely remained unexploited is providing health coverage via health insurance where the government rather than necessarily running its own health facilities is required to consider the alternative of providing health insurance to its citizens and time has come that India catches up with this alternative model of allocating resources and funding to its public health programs,&#8221; the judge said.</p>

" /> MGNREGA workers display the letter along with the Rs 5 note that they&#8217;ve written to PM Modi.
<p>In April this year, the Centre revised the MGNREGA wage across states with some, such as West Bengal and Assam, receiving a hike of Rs 2 and Rs 3 respectively. In Jharkhand, the rate was hiked from Rs 162 to Rs 167.</p>
<p>A drought-hit state, workers have now decided to return the Rs 5 to Prime Minister Modi, as a sign of protest, this May Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel that you need the extra five rupees more than we do, since your government has so many expenses,&#8221; the letter sent by a section of MGNREGA workers in Manika (Latehar, Jharkhand), reads.</p>
<p>&#8220;This action was initiated by Grameen Swaraj Mazdoor Sangh, a local organisation of rural workers. Among other activities, members of the Sangh are struggling to secure their rights under NREGA, including employment on demand and payment within 15 days. However, interest in NREGA work is waning in the area because wages are so low. The minimum wage in Jharkhand is Rs 212 per day,&#8221; a statement released, said.</p>
<p><em>Below is the full text of the letter</em></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Dear Prime Minister,</strong></p>
<p><strong>This year your government has increased the wages of NREGA workers in Jharkhand by five rupees (from Rs 162 per day to Rs 167 per day). We feel very lucky, because in 17 states the increase was even less. It sounds like NREGA workers in Odisha are now considered very well-off because their wages have not increased at all.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Actually, we are very concerned. The government must be really short of money if it is unable to raise NREGA wages to the minimum wage, that too when one third of the rural population is affected by drought. (For your kind information, the minimum wage in Jharkhand is Rs 212 per day.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>We feel that you need the extra five rupees more than we do, since your government has so many expenses. To implement the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, you will have to spend an additional Rs 1 lakh crore at least on salaries and pensions of government employees. Defence expenditure is about Rs 2.5 lakh crore. You must also be spending a lot of money on tax concessions for big companies, aside from giving them cheap land and other resources.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Considering all this, we NREGA workers have made a collective decision to give up our extra wages for a day and return the extra five rupees to you. We hope that this will help you to keep your corporate friends and government employees happy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your faithful workers,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Name:<br />
Job Card No:</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MGNREGA wage rates vary from state to state and are revised by indexing them to the consumer price index for agricultural labourers (CPIAL) for a particular state.</p>
<p>In the first two years of the job scheme, the wage rates had been the same as the minimum agricultural wage rates of the states concerned.</p>

<p>A 48-year-old Indian steelworker who fell sick at the World Cup site in Qatar has died of cardiac arrest, organisers of the 2022 football tournament said.</p>
<p>Jaleshwar Prasad, employed on the Al Bayt Stadium project, fell ill on-site on Wednesday, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, the body responsible for organising the Qatar World Cup, said.</p>
<p>He received first-aid treatment until paramedics arrived, the organisers said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was transferred to Al Khor Hospital but passed away (Saturday). Al Khor Hospital reported the cause of death as cardiac arrest,&#8221; the statement said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The family of Prasad has been informed of the tragedy immediately,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>A probe into the matter is underway as increasing number of labour abuses have been reported during the preparation of upcoming World Cup tournament that will cost around USD 30 billion.</p>
<p>Al Bayt is a stadium having a capacity to accommodate 60,000 people. It will be used for the World Cup tournament in 2022.</p>
<p>Amnesty released a report in March to highlight the abuses faced by the workers at the World Cup site in Qatar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Migrant labourers including from India faced abuse that in some cases amounted to forced labour while working on a stadium that will host soccer matches for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar,&#8221; Amnesty International had alleged.</p>
<p>Foreigners account for 90 per cent of the 2.5 million people living in Qatar, many of them low-paid migrant workers from South Asia, the report said.</p>
<p>The Indian population in the country currently stands at around 7,20,000.</p>

<p>Former Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda had ensured that the recommendation for entire Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block be made to Ministry of Coal (MOC) in favour of accused industrialist Naveen Jindal&#8217;s Group of companies only, a Delhi court has said.</p>
<p>The court&#8217;s observations came while ordering framing of charges against Jindal, Koda, former Minister of State for Coal Dasari Narayan Rao and 12 others including five firms.</p>
<p>In its order, the court said at this stage Koda&#8217;s conduct and other facts prima facie show meeting of mind between Jindal and Koda to the effect that recommendation for the coal block on behalf of the Jharkhand government be made in favour of accused firms Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) and Gagan Sponge Iron Pvt Ltd (GSIPL).</p>

<p>The court has ordered framing of charges against these accused for alleged offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating, criminal breach of trust under the IPC and under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though it was argued that Koda merely acted on the recommendation of the sub-group but in view of the statement of prosecution witness Aditya Swaroop coupled with the conduct of Koda previously in changing the recommendation of the sub- group&#8230;, it is prima facie clear that Koda being the chief minister of the state ensured that recommendation qua entire Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block be made to MoC in favour of Naveen Jindal Group of Companies only,&#8221; special CBI judge Bharat Parashar said.</p>
<p>Regarding Koda, the court noted that sub-group of three secretaries, formed by the then Chief Secretary of Jharkhand, had made recommendation in favour of certain companies about various coal blocks after forming some criteria.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the light of specific stand taken by ECI that after 2005 they have not registered any political party having connotation of religion, caste, creed, race, name of god or community in its name, we decline to entertain the petition. The petition is dismissed,&#8221; the bench said.</p>
<p>Citizen Rights Foundation had filed the plea which also sought to prevent such political parties from participating in the elections.</p>
<p>It had sought a direction to EC to take necessary action to change the name of these political parties within a period fixed by the court.</p>
<p>&#8220;The registration given to those political parties having any connotation of religion, caste, creed, race, name of god or community with their names is violation of the Constitution of India and against the various provisions of Representation of People Act and Rules, Regulation and Guidelines framed there under,&#8221; the plea had alleged.</p>

<p>It had claimed there were 16 registered political parties having connotation of religion in their names and they should be prohibited from collecting funds from the general public.</p>
<p>&#8220;Direct respondent one (Ministry of Law and Justice) to ensure, by legislation if necessary, that political parties having any connotation of the religion, caste, creed, race, name of god or community in its name is not participating in election,&#8221; it added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778693&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2778688" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/namdhari.jpg" alt="The murder of ‘Mataji’ Chand Kaur at their heavily guarded dera in Bhaini Sahib has shaken the Namdhari sect. Gurmeet Singh" /> The murder of ‘Mataji’ Chand Kaur at their heavily guarded dera in Bhaini Sahib has shaken the Namdhari sect. Gurmeet Singh
<p>AT THE imposing entrance of the Namdhari headquarters at Bhaini Sahib, some 30 km from Ludhiana in Punjab, hangs a huge portrait of ‘Mataji’. As devotees of this austere Sikh sect, clad in crisp white from head to toe, stream in through the main gate, they bow before the portrait; some wail while others click pictures on their mobile phones. A woman tells her child to kneel before the portrait, while another asks her daughter to cover her head properly — one of the many “lessons” from Mataji.</p>
<p>The reverence is telling for the 159-year-old wealthy sect, whose very existence is under threat following a brutal murder: less than a month ago, in the early hours of April 4, 88-year-old Chand Kaur, the matriarch of the Namdhari sect and Mataji to her followers, was gunned down inside the dera.</p>
<p>While women can never head the sect, Kaur was the matron ‘saint’ who held the influential six-lakh-member community together: she provided legitimacy to her nephew and the present Namdhari satguru (sect chief), Uday Singh, in the succession battle with his older brother Dalip Singh.</p>
<p>A few metres from the Mataji portrait, a white board, meant for devotees to pay tributes to the elderly woman, contains handwritten messages that sum up the turmoil in the dera since the murder. ‘The vacuum left by Mataji cannot be filled&#8230;’, reads one. ‘Mataji&#8230; please come back. You were our only hope&#8230;’, reads another.</p>

<p>The Namdhari factional battle has its genesis in 2009 — a year after the death of the brothers’ father, Maharaja Bir Singh — when the older Dalip Singh and their mother Dalip Kaur were ousted from Bhaini Sahib, allegedly on Uday’s directions. It worsened in 2012, when the previous satguru Jagjit Singh, Kaur’s husband and Maharaj Bir Singh’s brother, passed away. Since then, there have been over 30 incidents of violence between supporters of the brothers, including an attack on Uday Singh at a gurdwara in the UK in August 2014. Kaur’s murder though is unprecedented and has opened a can of worms for the sect: Whom should they consider as their guru, now that the only ‘peacemaker’ is no more? And more importantly, should they continue being Namdhari at all?</p>
<p>The divide in the community is over Uday Singh’s ascension. The brothers were in line to take over as Jagjit Singh and Chand Kaur had no male heir. Insiders say Jagjit may have wanted Dalip to be his successor but Chand Kaur supported Uday Singh; no one is sure of why she backed the younger brother.</p>
<p>The mystery over Chand Kaur’s murder has not helped matters either, coming as it did inside the heavily guarded dera. Police have made no arrests so far (they are yet to identify the accused) and the two brothers have been blaming each other.</p>
<p>“The seeds were sown in 2012 itself. We don’t know what happened behind the four walls of these palatial bungalows. We considered Jagjit Singhji as our satguru and his decision on a successor would have been supreme for us. But till date, it is a mystery as to who he wanted to take over from him,” says Surjit Kaur, a devotee from Bathinda, which is three hours away.</p>
<p>“There is no elder to solve this family dispute, which is affecting followers now. When satguru Jagjit was alive, we had hope. Even when Mataji was alive, there was still hope. We knew she would unite the clan and guide followers like us who are currently torn by this battle. Following satguru Jagjit’s death, there has never been a clear answer on who our guru is. Mataji supported Uday Singh but doubts have always been there,” says Namit Singh, another follower.</p>
<p>The cracks at the top are now tearing away at the social fabric of the Namdharis and splitting families. “Husbands are fighting with wives over believing in different gurus. Sons are disagreeing with fathers and families are entering into disputes. This is not what the Namdhari sect was all about. We believed in unity, not clashes. We believed in simplicity, not wars over wealth and succession. The entire meaning of our faith is being lost, vanishing to where it can never return from,” says Rachhpal Singh, a devotee.</p>
<p>At stake in the feud, apart from the sprawling Bhaini Sahib headquarters, with its manicured lawns, plush buildings and golf carts, is over 6,000 acres of land in Punjab and Haryana; farms in Ooty, Manali, Ludhiana, Thailand and Bengaluru; a fleet of luxury cars from Maybachs to Rolls Royces; and a multinational seed company with a turnover of over Rs 800 crore.</p>
<p>“Wealth will keep fillings the dera coffers but Namdhari followers are not increasing as expected&#8230; Our faith has been shaken with this becoming a battle of money and egos,” says Kirpal Singh, 46, from Moga, whose family has been a part of the sect for decades.</p>
<p>Founded in April 13, 1857, by Ram Singh, the Namdharis differ from mainstream Sikhism in their belief that the lineage of the living gurus continued after the10th Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh (hence the satgurus). They also maintain their own gurdwaras, practise strict vegetarianism and do not marry outside the sect. Most of the believers hail from Punjab, Haryana and include wealthy Sikhs in Thailand.</p>
<p>The older devotees feel their children may no longer follow their faith. “We are just a few lakh in number. Seeing this feud, even my son sometimes says ‘let us not get into this. Let us simply believe in pious Guru Granth Sahib like other Sikhs’. When both the gurus are themselves fighting, how can they preach peace to us? If this battle continues and gets uglier, which it will now with the murder of Mataji, we doubt if the coming generations will continue to be in the Namdhari faith,” says a follower who lives within Bhaini Sahib.</p>
<p>“In this war of rights and wrongs, it is the Namdhari sect which is the ultimate sufferer,” says another follower.</p>

<p>WITHIN A 10-sq km area and among a population of 15 lakh, more than 10 lakh residents in Kolkata’s Garden Reach are Muslims. With only sporadic pockets in this vast Kolkata Port area on the banks of river Hooghly inhabited by Hindus, the area, locals claim, has always been known as ‘doosra Pakistan’.</p>
<p>On Saturday, when Garden Reach voted, it was in news with state minister Firhad ‘Bobby’ Hakim — the area’s sitting MLA — calling it a “mini-Pakistan”.</p>

<p>“This is not the first time&#8230; From the very beginning, this area used to be known as ‘doosra Pakistan’. We have heard this expression being used again and again,” said Hakim Mohammad Rizwan, a local.</p>
<p>Garden Reach in Kidderpore is famous for a number of completely disparate reasons — for being the last residence of Awadh king Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, one of the largest riverine ports in the country (at the government owned Garden Reach Shipping Limited, ships are built and repaired) and for the notorious distinction of being a criminal hood.</p>
<p>The area is till remembered for the gruesome killing of Kolkata Port DCP Vinod Kumar Mehta and his bodyguard Mokhtar Ali Khan in the early 80s. Since then, it has seen a number of similar incidents of violence. “But that was many many years ago. Garden Reach is no longer violent. Everyone lives here peacefully, people of all religions,” said Rizwan.</p>
<p>However, despite such claims, Garden Reach has been named as one of the 800 “vulnerable areas” in Kolkata with its polling booth featuring among the 1,467 sensitive ones listed by the Election Commission in connection with the 53 constituencies that went to polls on Saturday.</p>
<p>Out of the 140 people arrested, including 20 with criminal backgrounds, a number were from Garden Reach. A cavalcade of police cars, RAF vehicles were seen patrolling the streets. CRPF jawans, too, kept vigil.</p>
<p>As soon as you enter Garden Reach, large posters with “Bobbyda’s” face printed on them stare down at passersby. “He shouldn’t have said that. He is a minister. He should have been careful. Maybe at one point, this was the feeling due to the presence of such a large population of Muslims. But after so many years of living here, we should not have to prove that we are Indians,” said Rizwan, who runs a Unani medicine shops, Qadri Dawakhana — set up by his grandfather when the family had arrived from Muzaffarpur in Bihar in 1930.</p>
<p>Garden Reach and its surrounding areas are entrepreneurial. Most residents are either tailors or supply construction materials. Around 6,000 people are employed in the shipping factories.</p>
<p>“There is no poverty here,” said Rizwan, adding that despite Hakim’s comments, his family has voted for Trinamool. “They are the ruling party. They will form the next government. Why should we waste our votes by voting for someone else?” he said.</p>
<p>In neighbouring Metiabruz, a colony of manufacturers of readymade garments, 44-year-old Riyaz Qureshi said he is fed up with the constant tension prevailing in the area and the intermittent fights between different factions of Trinamool. “Every once in a while, we have to shut our businesses and we lose money. Look at the police patrolling. I have never seen this area being so peaceful. If only they had police presence and patrolling in Metiabruz through the year, there would never be any trouble here,” he added.</p>
<p>With Section 144 of CrPC in place in Kolkata Port, the main road was empty but for the police. As a police cavalcade approached, Qureshi asked a group of boys to go home. “I have heard what Bobbyda has said. I don’t know if he has actually said it. But this is not a mini-Pakistan. We resent being called that. I have voted for the CPM&#8230; Trinamool has done nothing for us,” he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778651&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Gujarat government will set up a special hospital to carry out research on the “problem” in couples that might result in their having either only sons or only daughters, Chief Minister Anandiben Patel said on Saturday. She was aware that one of the major reasons for discord in families was “progeny”, the chief minister said.</p>
<p>“I am a woman, and being a woman I understand the stress that women undergo physically and mentally. There are so many women and so many families that we hear of where there is discord, and often divorces, because of the want of sons. If there are two girls and a third one arrives and they want sons, the man talks of remarrying, giving much mental stress to the women. Even if there is a fault with men, it is blamed on the women,” Patel told a Mahila Sammelan in Pavi Jetpur in Chhota Udepur on the occasion of Gujarat Foundation Day.</p>

<p>Patel, who was speaking in Gujarati, said: “Ghar ma bey dikrio janme aney treeji dikri janme etle em kehva ma aave, havey mane dikro joyiye chhey etla maate beeji patni karo. Purush ma dosh hova chhata pan dosh no toplo mahila upar nakhwama aavey chhey ane etla maate aapdi sarkar ane main nakki karyu chhey key aavi jetli pan samasayao chhey, e samasyao maatey ek special hospital banavvi joiye, jema eva parivaro aavey ane eno shodh-sanshodhan thaay ki kem&#8230; shaa maatey sattat dikriyo no janma thaay chhey&#8230; koi eva parivaro chhey ke bey dikraao chhey aney ghar ma dikri pan joiye chhey&#8230; ghar ma dikri pan joyiye chhey&#8230; parantu dikri no janma thato naathi&#8230; aney eni pann ichha adhuri rahi jay chhey&#8230;” (“If there are two daughters born in the home, and the third child born is also a daughter, then she is told, now I want a son, so get another wife. Even if the fault is with the man, the entire burden of the fault is on the woman’s head, and so our government and I have decided that for all such problems, there should be a special hospital, where families can come and there would be research on why, for what reason, back-to-back daughters are born&#8230; there are some families that have two sons and the home wants a daughter&#8230; the home also wants a daughter&#8230; but the daughter is not born&#8230; and their desire remains unfulfilled&#8230;”)</p>
<p>The state-of-the-art hospital had been provided for in the state Budget for this year, and would be set up soon in Ahmedabad, the chief minister said.</p>
<p>She went on to say, “&#8230;There are physically deformed children being born and miscarriages that are stressful. I keep listening to these stories. But today, there is technology. I can assure you that this can be treated in the womb&#8230; All such women who are pregnant&#8230; families who give birth to speech- and hearing-impaired and physically challenged children&#8230; On the one hand, there will be a hospital where such mothers can go&#8230; and by sonography they can be treated, and on the other hand there can be research on such families to find out what is the reason behind this? Whose DNA should be changed to get rid of these problems? Therefore in this year’s budget, a woman and child care hospital will be ready in Ahmedabad in eight months which will solve these problems.”</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> had reported on April 28 the case of a tribal couple in Garbhada taluka in Dahod, who are hoping that their 17th child would be a son.</p>

<p>AS THE curtains come down on round two of the odd-even road space rationing scheme, the Delhi government is in a quandary. While it ponders whether it should implement the scheme through the year or shift tactics to combat the problem of air pollution, preliminary data from an MIT research project on the odd-even scheme may hold some insights.</p>
<p>The MIT study, organised by High compliance, but more commuters switched to second car, says study the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) South Asia and funded and supported by the International Growth Centre (IGC India), focuses on traffic congestion and driver behaviour, and uses <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/google/">Google</a> Maps travel time queries and phone surveys with at least 1,000 randomly selected drivers in Delhi.</p>
<p>Analysis of the data from this research project was published in <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> after the first round of the road rationing policy between January 1 and January 15.</p>

<p>Gabriel Kreindler, a doctoral candidate studying urban transportation in the economics department at MIT, is leading a second study on the odd-even policy in Delhi. “We have continued to collect data through surveys and Google Maps since the scheme began on January 1. There are differences between the first and second phases of the scheme,” said Kreindler.</p>
<p>Preliminary analysis showed that while traffic congestion eased considerably between April 15 and April 30 as compared to the weeks in between, more households switched to other cars or taxis on days their own vehicles were restricted.</p>
<p>The project includes a sample of 920 commuters — male, diesel/ petrol car owners and regular users — at randomly selected petrol pumps in Delhi. Regular surveys were conducted with the commuters by phone, on both odd and even days. At least 3,000 phone surveys were completed in January and April, before and during odd-even 2.0.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2778725" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/pollution-mit-1.jpg" alt="pollution-mit-1" width="759" height="516" /></p>
<p><strong>Compliance</strong></p>
<p>The data shows higher compliance of the scheme compared to January. While 17.5 per cent of respondents violated the policy in January, in April the number dropped to 9.5 per cent. In the week before the odd-even scheme was implemented, 48.8 per cent had used their cars regularly.</p>
<p>The reasons for non-compliance included commuting before 8 am and after 8 pm to avoid the policy, travel within their housing blocks and travelling out of Delhi, in that order.</p>
<p>Data also shows that some commuters used another car — possibly borrowed or bought — or switched to taxis and auto rickshaws instead of buses and the Metro. While 6.9 per cent of respondents said they switched to another household car in January, in April that number rose to 18.8 per cent. Fewer commuters switched to two-wheelers — while 15.8 per cent of those surveyed used a two-wheeler in January, 12.7 per cent took to two-wheelers in April.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, respondents who switched to taxis or auto rickshaws stayed the same — 11.8 per cent in January compared to 10.8 this time. However, while fewer car owners restricted by the scheme moved to buses and the Metro compared to January, the data showed a significant increase compared to the week before the scheme was implemented.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2778727" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/1ac907e6-7480-4cbd-84f4-302d80ffd646.jpg" alt="1ac907e6-7480-4cbd-84f4-302d80ffd646" width="759" height="1112" /></p>
<p><strong>Congestion</strong></p>
<p>According to the data collected, travel time across Delhi was similar or moderately faster than in January. Respondents were asked if they experienced congestion on the roads before and during the odd-even scheme. While 27.2 per cent stated they faced congestion in the week before the scheme, that number dipped to 7.9 per cent on restricted days.</p>
<p>The data also showed that commuters cut back on trips on days their cars were restricted — 62 per cent of respondents made trips on days their cars were restricted in April compared to 72 per cent in January.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[They also felt that inclusion of crimes like murder and culpable homicide, but exclusion of tax offences under ‘predicate offence’ for money laundering probe was out of place.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778645&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2197863 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/10/black-money.jpg" alt="Black-Money" /> &#8220;Law breakers are more abreast with technology than the enforcers of law. There is a need for a strong wing to deal with the technological aspect of probes.&#8221;
<p>At a time when the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is probing big ticket cases of money laundering such as the AgustaWestland deal, Supreme Court Judge J Chelameswar and retired Justice Arijit Pasayat — who is now vice-chairman of the Special Investigation Team on black money — on Saturday called for a more stringent Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) with increased jail term.</p>
<p>Both were of the opinion that the seven-year sentence prescribed under the PMLA is too less, given the gravity of the offences. They also felt that inclusion of crimes like murder and culpable homicide, but exclusion of tax offences under ‘predicate offence’ for money laundering probe was out of place.</p>
<p>Speaking at a function to celebrate ED Day, Justice Chelameswar said it is time to “re-examine” the PMLA. “The legislative policy behind PMLA left me amused for many reasons&#8230; Money laundering can have far reaching consequences on the lives of the people. So why only seven years of sentence (for such offenders)? Is the sentencing policy in tune with the ambition of the Act,” he asked.</p>

<p>Raising the same issue later, Justice (retd) Pasayat cited the example of the United States where such offenders are sentenced for up to 150 years. “How I wish we had such sentencing here. Those stealing one rupee and those laundering Rs 300 crore are given the same sentence here,” he said.</p>
<p>Justice Chelameswar also questioned the wisdom behind including offences like culpable homicide not amounting to murder in the schedule of ‘predicate offences’, based on which ED conducts its money laundering probe.</p>
<p>“While murder and attempt to murder are predicate offences, tax offences are still not included in the category. If you are evading massive amount of tax, that is murder of the economy which will eventually impact people,” said Justice (retd) Pasayat.</p>
<p>“The idea behind the law was to get unaccounted wealth that has gone out of the country back into the main framework&#8230; but even culpable homicide not amounting to murder is included. Many such offences are in Schedule 1 of the Act&#8230; How does it impact economy,” asked Justice Chelameswar.</p>
<p>“I am not questioning the legislative wisdom of Parliament. Courts can’t interfere in that. But a citizen can ask. I am talking as a citizen,” he said.</p>
<p>He said such an approach of “putting everything in a capsule” is detrimental to the efficacy of the Act and tends to render the law vulnerable to abuse. He cited the example of Section 66A of the IT Act which resulted in many arbitrary arrests. Justice Chelameswar was behind the court order which struck down the section.</p>
<p>Commenting on the staff shortage in ED, Justice Chelameswar said “the organisational structure (of ED) remains purely dependent on executive discretion.” He said 90 per cent of the staff were on deputation from other departments. Against a sanctioned strength of 2067, ED’s actual strength is just 697.</p>
<p>He also stressed the need for the ED to have a strong legal department, and urged its sleuths to be more tech-savvy. “Law breakers are more abreast with technology than the enforcers of law. There is a need for a strong wing to deal with the technological aspect of probes,” he said. Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha was among those present at the function.</p>

(Express Photo By Amit Mehra)
<p>BANNING ALL diesel and petrol-run taxis in the National Capital Region (NCR), the Supreme Court on Saturday held that only CNG-fitted private taxis, including those being operated by aggregators like Ola and Uber, will be allowed to ply from Sunday.</p>
<p>Holding a special hearing, a bench led by Chief Justice T S Thakur declined to extend the April 30 deadline fixed for conversion of all diesel and petrol-run taxis to CNG mode.</p>
<p>Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for some taxi owners, contended that there is no technology for converting diesel vehicles into CNG mode. “We will not be able to earn our livelihood. Moreover, we have to repay the bank loans taken to buy these taxis too,” he said.</p>
<p>But the bench, also comprising Justices A K Sikri and R Banumathi, turned down the plea for extension of deadline, pointing out that it had already been extended three times since last year.</p>
<p>On December 16 last year, the deadline for conversion to CNG mode was set as March 1. It was later extended to March 31, and then to April 30. “We are not going to extend the deadline any further,” said the bench today.<br />
In its December 16 order, the court had observed that the move “will contribute substantially to reduction of pollution.”</p>

<p>The bench today also extended its ban on fresh registrations of diesel vehicles with engine capacity of 2000 cc and above in the NCR till further orders. It said the issues relating to the continuing ban on registration as well as imposing environment cess on new diesel vehicles would be taken up on May 9.</p>
<p>The court, however, allowed Delhi Police and Delhi Jal Board to register their new diesel-run vehicles of 2000 cc and above for transportation of undertrial prisoners, arms and ammunition and supply of water. It asked Delhi Police to pay 30 per cent of the cost of the vehicle as Environment Compensation Charge (ECC). The Delhi Jal Board was exempted from the green cess on the ground that it ferries water tankers to people.</p>
<p>During the hearing, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing automobile manufactures, read out a report prepared by IIT-Kanpur that said diesel cars accounted for 0.3 per cent of Delhi’s air pollution. He said there were various other factors such as dust and industrial pollutants which contributed to the pollution.</p>
<p>“Why no difference is made in pollution level in Delhi, even after steps have been taken like odd-even scheme, diversion of trucks from the national capital? What are the solutions? More than 60,000 trucks have been barred everyday from entering Delhi, yet the study suggests no improvement in air quality,” observed the bench.</p>
<p>It also pulled up the Centre for “waiting for someone to wake it up from deep slumber” when the latter agreed to examine a proposal to install a device, catalytic converter, in vehicles to reduce pollution in emission.</p>
<p>“Now you have woken up from deep slumber. What was the ministry doing all these days? You wait for someone to bring out something. This is a matter affecting everybody. You should examine the position in the rest of the world. What are your officials doing? Are they sitting in their plush office and sipping coffee? The ministry should do it,” the bench told Additional Solicitor General Maninder Singh.</p>

<p>He said that party workers from all over the state would be assembling in Bhavnagar on Monday and a “jail bharo andolan” would be launched outside the Bhavnagar jail if Kalsariya and other party workers were denied bail. Nayak said that national party leaders from Delhi would also land in Bhavnagar on May 4 and take part in the “jail bharo andolan”.</p>
<p>Asked why did Kalsariya not agree for bail on Friday when he was produced in the court after his arrest, Nayak said police wanted Kalsariya to give in writing an undertaking that he would not launch any agitation in the future or not take part in any public movement. “This is because of this that Kalsariya refused to seek bail,” said Nayak. “The police is suppressing the human and democratic rights of the people,” said the AAP leader.</p>
<p>AAP had launched a three-day “gauchar bachao yatra” on Friday against the allotment of grazing land to a corporate houses in Karamdiya village of Bhavnagar district. Kalsariya had earlier led a successful agitation against the allotment of huge tract of land for a cement plant in Mahuva taluka of Bhavnagar district. After that, Kalsariya quit the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> and joined AAP.</p>

<p>Over 100 intellectuals, including noted historians Romila Thapar, Irfan Habib and D N Jha, Saturday issued a statement against the “attack” on “distinguished historian” Bipan Chandra, and said it had become a “habit for so-called nationalists to raise non-substantial issues to parade their patriotism”.</p>
<p>The statement issued by the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (SAHMAT) comes in the backdrop of Delhi University’s (DU) decision to stop the sale and distribution of the Hindi translation of Chandra’s book — ‘India’s Struggle for Independence’ — which refers to Bhagat Singh as a “revolutionary terrorist”.</p>

<p>“In recent days, it seems to have become a habit of some&#8230; ‘nationalists’ to raise divisive or non-substantial issues to parade their patriotism. The most recent example of this is the attack on a major history (book) of the national movement authored by distinguished historian, Professor Bipan Chandra, and his colleagues. The objection is that Shaheed Bhagat Singh and his comrades have been described as “revolutionary terrorists”. Critics, however, forget that this was really a term the martyrs had practically used for themselves,” read the statement.</p>
<p>It added, “If we claim to be nationalists, we should at least know more about our national movement and not forget that there was a time when this tag was borne with pride by people who actually died for the cause of this country.</p>
<p>Let us not go about demanding changes in books, or banning them altogether and display our own ignorance to the world. The withdrawal of the translation of the book by Delhi University and hounding of the authors on TV shows and at law courts&#8230; is only too characteristic of such campaigns&#8230;”</p>
<p>The statement has been signed by several current and former DU history professors including Amar Farooqui, Biswamoy Pati, R C Thakran and B P Sahu, JNU professors Jayati Ghosh, C P Chandrashekhar, Ajay Patnaik and Ayesha Kidwai, theatre personalities M K Raina, N K Sharma and Moloyshree Hashmi and director Saeed Mirza, among others.</p>
<p>Citing examples of Bhagat Singh’s use of the word “terrorist” for himself, the statement said, “The Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, to which Bhagat Singh and his colleagues belonged, said in its Manifesto (1929): ‘We have been taken to task for our terrorist policy. No doubt, the revolutionaries think and rightly that it is only by resorting to terrorism that they can find a most effective means of retaliation’&#8230;”</p>
<p>While accepting that Bhagat Singh had stated at a later stage, “Apparently, I have acted like a terrorist; But I am not a terrorist”, and that “two definitions of the word ‘terror’ were already at work”, the statement also said that for them, “terror had till then seemed a revolutionary path that they were wholly committed to”.</p>
<p>Explaining the historical context of the word “terror”, the statement says, “Terror as a method of revolutionary action actually derived from a tradition that went back to the Russian revolutionaries’ struggle against Czarist tyranny.”</p>
<p>“However, in the last two or three decades, terror has come to mean the killing of innocent men, women and children almost all over the world. It has thus assumed a heavily pejorative sense, not necessarily borne by it in the 1920s and 30s,” it added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778595&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Making a fresh attack on the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> leadership, the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> on Saturday claimed that the UPA brass overrode objections raised by its own defence minister over relaxations extended to AgustaWestland choppers.</p>
<p>Addressing the media in New Delhi, BJP spokesperson G V L Narsimha Rao alleged that Congress president <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/">Sonia Gandhi</a> overrode objections raised by then defence minister A K Antony regarding field trial of the choppers.</p>
<p>Referring to the recent verdict of an Italian court, Rao alleged, “Sonia Gandhi and Ahmed Patel are in the dock. They are architects of the scam.” He added that the real size of the “scam” is bigger than what has come to light so far.</p>

<p>Refuting Congress’s claim that AgustaWestland was blacklisted during the UPA regime, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in Thiruvananthapuram to release the NDA’s vision document ahead of Kerala Assembly polls, said: “This is a figment of somebody’s imagination&#8230;. The buck stops with those who took the decision, and the decision was influenced by bribery&#8230;. There is a transaction in which (the) bribe-giver is being convicted. We are only struggling to find out the identity of bribe-taker&#8230;Those who influenced (the) decision get bribes.”</p>

<p>In Delhi, Rao said, “A K Antony had questioned the proposal to have the field trial abroad. This is what the CAG report also cites&#8230;The Defence Minister wants RFP (request for proposals) conditions to be imposed. Who in the UPA or who in the Congress other than Sonia Gandhi and her adviser Ahmed Patel, has the authority to override Antony (and) his objections? The only one (leader) who could tell him to keep quiet, who could silence him, was Sonia Gandhi.”</p>

<p>Facing an attack from the Centre and the BJP over the AgustaWestland chopper deal, the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> Saturday went on the offensive, alleging that the NDA government had been “helping” the firm. It said the BJP had been “protecting” the company for the last two years as investigations by the CBI and the ED had made no progress.</p>
<p>Congress communication department head Randeep Surjewala threw a volley of questions at BJP president Amit Shah, who had Friday targeted Congress chief <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/">Sonia Gandhi</a> in connection with the case.</p>
<p>Claiming that Shah had called AgustaWestland and Finmeccanica a “fraud company”, he asked, “Will Shah and the BJP answer why the same fraud company was permitted to be part of Prime Minister’s Make in India programme and participate in Aero India Exhibition?”</p>

<p>Besides, the company was given permission by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board to set up an assembly unit at Indian Rotorcraft Ltd — a joint venture between AgustaWestland and Tata Aerospace — in October 2015, he said. The company, he said, was also given permission to participate in defence contracts.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778580&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Source: PTI photo)
<p>Although he did not directly support Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar on Saturday echoed the JD(U) president’s stand that all non-<a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> parties should come together against Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> and the Sangh brand of politics during his maiden visit to his home state since his arrest, and subsequent bail, in Delhi on charges of <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/what-is-section-124-a-under-which-one-is-charged-with-sedition/">sedition</a>.</p>
<p>Kanhaiya met both Nitish and RJD chief Lalu Prasad in Patna. After meeting the RJD chief, Kanhaiya said: “We discussed the current situation in the country. Lalu Prasad has contributed immensely towards realising social justice.”</p>
<p>The RJD chief said: “Kanhaiya belongs to Brahamarshi samaj (upper caste Bhumihars) but talks of Dalits.” In his deliberations with the Chief Minister, which lasted for nearly an hour, Kanhaiya reportedly discussed alternative politics.</p>

<p>Interacting with the media later, Kanhaiya slammed the BJP, something he has been doing regularly at public events over the last couple of months. He said that the saffron party, instead of “taking care of the Tricolour”, is trying to “hand out saffron flags”. Emphasising that an “alternative” brand of politics has begun in the country, Kanhaiya said: “We are against an ideology in which only one individual is being talked about. All opposition parties need to unite to help one another.”</p>
<p>The JNUSU president began his three-day Bihar trip by first visiting Patna’s Gandhi Maidan and Kargil Chowk. During his trip, Kanhaiya is scheduled to attend a function titled “Aazadi” by AISF, and a meeting of JNU ex-students.</p>

<p>Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, who complained of pain in his stomach and abdomen on Saturday was admitted to the Guwahati Medical College Hospital later in the evening. Hospital officials however said he was out of danger.</p>
<p>“The chief minister experienced abdominal upset in the morning, following which he complained of pain. While he was admitted to the hospital at around 8 pm on Saturday and has been put under observation after carrying out the necessary investigations, his condition is stable,” GMC hospital superintendent Dr Babul Bezbaruah said late Saturday evening.</p>
<p>Gogoi (82) who had undergone multiple surgeries including a by-pass in 2010, who holds record of being Assam chief minister for three consecutive terms since 2001, had only recently headed the hectic campaign of the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> party in the just-concluded state assembly elections, during which he toured the entire length and breadth of the state.</p>

<p>In view of the drought that has directly affected a quarter of the country’s population — about 300 million people living in 10 states — the committee of secretaries headed by the Cabinet Secretary is expected to meet on Monday to outline plans for water storage and conservation.</p>
<p>The meeting will also involve Chief Secretaries of all states and union territories. “In his last Mann ki Baat address on the radio, Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> had called on the need for revolutionary steps to mitigate the effects of drought.</p>
<p>The PMO has since indicated that the next four to six weeks are crucial to ensure water conservation measures are in place prior to the monsoon,” said a senior government official.</p>

<p>With the IMD having forecast above normal rainfall, plans involve a special focus on harnessing rainwater during the monsoon. The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has been appointed as the nodal ministry for overseeing the implementation of the plans on a fortnightly basis throughout the year.</p>
<p>A draft note for the committee of secretaries states how the cumulative water storage levels are way below the normal mark in every state except for Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Tripura, with reservoirs in the western and southern regions of the country having the least amount of water.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778577&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>While all of them were questioned earlier, a CBI source said “they were called again in the light of the Milan Court of Appeals conviction order, and some new facts which have come to light”.</p>
<p>Sources said Gujral, who is being treated as a witness in the case, has agreed to appear before the CBI again. “He has given us some information. Based on that, we will question S P Tyagi on Monday. We will again call him (Gujral) for questioning later,” said a CBI source.</p>

<p>Gujral, who was IAF procurement chief in 2005, was reportedly part of the meeting in March 2005 where the issue regarding a change in technical specifications of the choppers was purportedly discussed. S P Tyagi and then NSA, M K Narayanan, were also reported to have attended the meeting.</p>
<p>The CBI has registered a case against S P Tyagi and 12 others, including his three cousins, and five foreign nationals in the case. Six companies — Italy-based Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland, Mohali-based IDS Infotech, Chandigarh-based Aeromatrix, IDS Tunisia and IDS Mauritius — have also been named in the FIR.</p>
<p>Sources said the agency has examined more than 100 people in connection with the case, including all the Indians accused, while it needs to examine five foreign nationals. The agency has sent judicial requests to eight countries in its attempt to unravel the money trail of the alleged bribe of around Rs 400 crore.</p>
<p>According to sources, the agency has received responses from Italy, British Virgin Islands, United Kingdom and Tunisia.</p>

<p>The Congress announced on Saturday that top leaders, led by party president <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/">Sonia Gandhi</a> and vice-president <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/rahul-gandhi/">Rahul Gandhi</a>, will take part in a march on May 6 and then lay siege to Parliament to protest the alleged “toppling” of its governments in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh.</p>
<p>The party had planned to take out a “save democracy march” to Parliament earlier this month. Now, with the AgustaWestland chopper deal returning to haunt the Congress, and the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> and its government leaving no stone unturned to target the Gandhis, the party said it would also highlight the campaign of “deceit and deliberate lies” launched against it. Congress would also attack the government on its “failure” to tackle the drought situation in the country.</p>
<p>Sonia, Rahul and a host of top Congress leaders would march from Jantar Mantar in the morning and then lay siege to Parliament. This would be the first major street protest by the party, under fire from the BJP and the government over the chopper deal and the Ishrat Jahan affidavit controversy, in over a year.</p>

Later, Sonia had led a couple of marches to the President’s House, first on the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/land-bill/">land bill</a> and then on the “growing intolerance” in the country.</p>
<p>The party’s communication department head Randeep Surjewala said that the main issue in the march would be the “toppling” of elected governments by use of “money and muscle”.</p>
<p>In Jaipur, PCC president Sachin Pilot confirmed that the Rajasthan unit of the party will participate in the march. “We have seen the undemocratic face of the Modi government in Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand,” he told PTI.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A website publishing preachings of influential Australian Islamic preacher Musa Cerantonio, another propagating the ideology of Al-Qaeda and the third originating from a tiny island country of Nauru are some of the prominent webpages blocked by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) recently. With these three new websites, the total number of sites blocked by ATS has increased to 97.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malhamaah.co.nr" rel="nofollow">http://www.malhamaah.co.nr</a> a website whose domain is registered in Nauru, located in the North-east side of Australia has now been blocked by the state counter terrorism agency for propagating the ideology of the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/islamic-state/">Islamic State</a> (IS) or Daesh as it is now referred by the Western world. Nauru, formerly known as Pleasant Island, is an island country in Micronesia in the Central Pacific.</p>

<p>“We have blocked the website as it propagated and tried to influence Indian youth into joining IS. It had some traffic from India because of which we blocked it,” said a senior ATS officer.</p>
<p>According to the officer, another link <a href="http://en.islamway.net/scholar/2581/musa-cerantonio" rel="nofollow">http://en.islamway.net/scholar/2581/musa-cerantonio</a> has also been blocked.</p>
<p>Cerantonio, 30, is an Australian Islamist preacher described by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) as one of two English-speaking “spiritual authorities” inspiring foreign fighters in Syria.</p>
<p>While his Twitter and <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/facebook/">Facebook</a> accounts have been shut down, many of his videos continue to remain on YouTube.</p>
<p>He is currently staying under police surveillance in Australia where he was born and raised. Born Robert Cerantonio to an Irish-Catholic family, Cerantonio converted to Islam when he was 17.</p>
<p>The third link that has been blocked by the ATS is the 12th issue of Inspire Magazine, a mouthpiece of Al-Qaeda.</p>
<p><a href="http://azelin.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/insppire-magazine-issue12.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://azelin.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/insppire-magazine-issue12.pdf</a> has now been blocked.</p>
<p>“We try and look after issues of magazines belonging to terror outfits that not only propagate their ideologies but try and lure youth from foreign countries,” said the officer.</p>
<p>Magazine Dabiq, the mouthpiece of IS has also met the same fate.</p>
<p>“Dabiq is published using ‘deep web’ (invisible web which are part of the World Wide Web but their content are not indexed by standard search engines) so sometimes monitoring these websites gets difficult. However, we ensure that these issues are not accessed as they are highly radical in nature,” added the official.</p>
<p>In the past, the agency had suspended the Twitter handles suspected to have been operated by one of the four Kalyan youth who fled to Iraq in May 2014 to fight alongside the terrorist organisation the IS.</p>
<p>The four young men identified as Areeb Majid, Fahad Shaikh, Amaan Tandel and Saheem Tanki hail from Kalyan, a satellite town of Mumbai.</p>
<p>On May 25, they left along with 40 others by an Etihad flight to Baghdad on a pilgrimage.</p>
<p>On May 31, they called for a private taxi which dropped them at Mosul. Since then they went missing and were believed to have joined the militant group.</p>
<p>However, Majeed returned to India in November last year. Following which the National Investigating Agency (NIA) booked him and the other three under Section 125 of the IPC (waging war with an Asiatic ally) and certain sections (16, 18, 20) of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778562&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>West Bengal Minister for Urban Development and Municipal Affairs Firhad Hakim, popularly known as Bobby Hakim, found himself in the eye of a storm after an interview in Pakistani daily Dawn quoted him as calling Kolkata’s Garden Reach area “mini-Pakistan”. The article was titled ‘Canvassing in mini-Pakistan of Kolkata’.</p>
<p>In an interview to Dawn’s Maleeha Hamid Siddiqui, Hakim was quoted as saying, “Please come along and let us take you to mini-Pakistan in Kolkata.” He was referring to Garden Reach area which falls in his constituency, where Siddiqui was following him on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>On Saturday, addressing the media at a polling booth in Chetla — the colony where Hakim lives with his family — he said, “This is a ploy to create communal tension. Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> has gone to Pakistan three-four times. That is okay. But if I, as a Muslim, say anything, then it is not okay. Why so? I am as much a son of the soil as Narendra Modi. This is nothing but discrimination.”</p>

<p>He also denied calling Garden Reach mini-Pakistan. “I never said that. I deny it. It’s just that a journalist from Pakistan had come along with me and she happened to find that the area reminded her of Pakistan, that’s all. If someone were to say that Kolkata is like London, then would there be this reaction? What is this reaction for, I ask you,” he said.</p>
<p>The Dawn article went viral hours before the fifth phase of the West Bengal polls, in which Kolkata Port — the constituency where Hakim is MLA from — also voted.</p>
<p>Hakim was one of the 11 TMC leaders shown purportedly accepting cash in a sting operation carried out by Narada News.</p>

As supporters of RSP says they are beaten by TMC . (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul).
<p>Clashes between the RSP and TMC left at least seven RSP workers injured, at Bhangulkhali area of Basanti Assembly in South 24 Parganas district in West Bengal on Saturday during the fifth phase of West Bengal polls. The attacks were allegedly sparked off by attempts made by TMC to try and influence voters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the TMC has alleged that the incident was engineered by the RSP and the central forces used &#8216;excessive force&#8217; in the area, leading to further tension.</p>
<p>The first clash took place at around 11.00 am on Saturday when RSP workers, near the polling booth at the Bhangunkhali Primary School, were attacked by TMC workers from a neighbouring village. &#8220;They came in waves. We were going to vote when they came on bikes, armed with sticks and attacked us. They kept beating us until they realised our workers were coming. Then, at around 11.30 am, there was a second wave,&#8221; alleged Atiyar Sheikh, a RSP worker and a resident of the area.</p>

<p>Sitting MLA from Basanti, RSP&#8217;s Subhash Naskar has not lost from the seat since first winning in 1982. The former irrigation minister is one of the few Left Front leaders who resisted the TMC&#8217;s &#8216;poriborton wave&#8217; in 2011. Police sources maintained that the RSP&#8217;s dominion in the area was almost unquestionable and senior police officers, who had tried to arrest accused persons in Bhangulkhali had also been attacked in the past.</p>
<p>Apart from Atiyar Sheikh (33), Ramzar Sheikh (28) and Motiyar Sheikh (31) were also seriously injured. They added that the incident was sparked off by the presence of a &#8220;lady from the other village&#8221; who is the wife of a Trinamool <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> leader. Motiyar added, &#8220;We told the police who were posted at the polling booth, but they turned a blind eye. This has been the case for the past few days. The police has been wining and dining with the same goons who attacked us. Today, one of them tried stabbing me with a broken beer bottle and I just escaped from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ramzar Sheikh added, &#8220;The woman who was here, was offering money for votes, while at other times, she was threatening them openly. Her husband, Noor Mohammad in the neighboring village is a businessman and a TMC party member.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the initial two waves of attacks, both parties called in for reinforcements. By 12.15 pm, the polling booth was under heavy security by a central force team. Meanwhile, the RSP &#8211; now armed and reinforced &#8211; had driven the TMC to one end of the Basanti Road, opposite the school. By 12.30 pm, the TMC had also asked for more reinforcements and both parties clashed again. Bamboos, stakes and sticks were wielded while the police tried desperately to control the situation.</p>
<p>A CISF officer, who didn&#8217;t wish to be named, said, &#8220;Our instructions are to guard the polling booth. We have been asked to not interfere with the party clashes. But had the police called us earlier, things wouldn&#8217;t have gotten so much out of hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>By 12.45 pm, the villagers &#8211; consisting of RSP party workers and supporters in the Left bastion &#8211; became increasingly agitated, alleging that &#8216;chappa vote&#8217; was going on and tried to clamber over the wall and into the school. The CISF team guarding the spot tried to disperse the crowd using lathi charge, but when that didn&#8217;t work, they drew their weapons and threatened to shoot. The protests immediately dispersed. But the CISF officer said, &#8220;The area is very tense. It&#8217;s just a question of waiting till the time voting goes on. There will definitely be another attack later in the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, TMC candidate Gobindo Naskar, who visited the spot, wasn&#8217;t even allowed to get off his vehicle. He told Indian Express, &#8220;I have heard there has been some incident here, but I know that no one from TMC was involved in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Basanti PS officer-in-charge Kaushik Kundu maintained, &#8220;There was some tension. But things are under control now.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778078&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Express Photo: Abhijit Alka Anil)
<p>“In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends,” states a quote of Martin Luther King Jr on the wall of Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society’s office. The society, which faces demolition of the building, insists it still receives letters from prospective buyers. And the Supreme Court is where they seek both solace and justice.</p>
<p>The quote is pasted on the wall by retired Brigadier T K Sinha, chairman of the Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society, who is positive on moving Supreme Court against the demolition order of the Bombay High Court. He points at the deliberation of 2002 where Urban Development Department and Ministry of Environment and Forests had communicated on the clearances. Thereafter, he says, the society got environmental clearance and Rs 16 crore was paid to the government as it is government land.</p>

<p>In 2010, the commencement as well as completion certificate were given in four stages followed by the Occupation Certificate in September, 2010. “Even the MMRDA, in an affidavit, brought on record that everything is legal,” he insists.</p>
<p>The membership was according to the government resolution of 1999, where it has insisted upon reservation for 20% reservation for SC/ST. In addition, membership was given to Army and Navy officials and the rest was for the general category. “All 103 names for membership were cleared by the state government. The 25-odd names of people with political background is pending with the government. And how is it possible to have a threat from only this residential building whereas there are several residential highrises in the vicinity,” asserts Sinha.</p>
<p>R C Thakur, the society’s chief promoter, says the society still received applications from buyers until last week. “We decided to give occupancy to only Army officials,” he says.</p>
<p>The judgment came as a shock, but its stay for 12 weeks is a big respite. According to Thakur, the flats that were given to politicians were all approved by the state government. “If the government wants to throw them, they can. However, the common man should not suffer. The occupants belonging to Navy, Army and SC/ST should be protected,” says Thakur. The management also informed that Suresh Prabhu is still a member. An inactive member though. The issue of membership of 25 members who have political affiliations is before the collector.</p>
<p>“Even the MMRDA has on record said that every inch of Adarsh is legal. Who could question them. They hold legal statute. Even the Adani Port and Lavasa were without environmental clearance but those were regularised by them having paid a nominal penalty after environmental damage was quantified. Here, there is no question of any environmental damage,” says Thakur.</p>
<p>If a bureaucrat has committed an error, the management stresses, why should the entire building suffer. “Even in the case of Campa Cola, where illegality has been established, the demolition was stayed by the Supreme Court. Then why us?” he asks.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after Chief Justice of India T S Thakur made an impassioned plea before the government to help upgrade judicial infrastructure and start addressing the shortage of judges, Supreme Court judge Justice J Chelameswar held the government partly responsible for pendency of cases in courts.</p>
<p>He said that government was enacting new laws but not creating judicial infrastructure to deal with them, leading to pendency of cases. Chelameswar was speaking at a function at the Enforcement Directorate Day with MoS (Finance) Jayant Sinha on the dais.</p>
<p>“There are many reasons (for delay in courts). But one of the problems &#8230;only you (Sinha) can handle. The enthusiasm exhibited by the legislature in making new laws is not of the same degree when it comes to creating infrastructure for enforcement of that law,” he said.</p>

<p>He said that while new laws are made, lack of enhancement in manpower and infrastructure in courts results in cases piling up. “You give a judge 30 cases a month, the efficiency level will be something. You give him 300 cases a month and you can imagine what will happen. Don’t drop the jurisdiction of new laws on the same district judge,” he said, demanding that the government create new forums for dealing with new laws.</p>
<p>“It is time the lawmakers realise that every time they make a new law, they need to make provisions, both financial and administrative, for adjudication of disputes. And this should happen in a new forum,” said Chelameswar.</p>
<p>On April 24, Justice Thakur, while addressing a joint conference of chief ministers and chief justices of high courts, with Prime Minister Modi and Union Law Minister D V Sadananda Gowda present on the dais, had raised the same issue.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Justice Thakur regretted “inaction” on the government’s part in strengthening the judicial infrastructure and increasing the judge-population ratio to tackle the “avalanche” of cases. He said that “it is not enough to criticise” the judiciary alone for the huge pendency.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778559&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The town of Thathri in Doda district saw massive protests and a complete shutdown on Saturday, with people blocking the Doda-Batote road following the mystery death of a pregnant woman. The protesters alleged that the victim, Shaista Begum, 23, was killed by her in-laws.</p>
<p>Shaista Begum was charred to death under suspicious circumstances in a fire that broke out in her house on Friday night. Following public unrest, the police arrested her husband, Abdul Hamid, father-in-law Khursheed Malik and brother-in-law Azhar Malik on murder charges.</p>
<p>While the police said the matter is under investigation, locals suspect foul play since the deceased had lodged a police complaint of domestic violence against her in-laws only two days before her death. Shaista Begum and Abdul Hamid had married two years ago.</p>

<p>Stating that the organisation Anjuman-e-Islamia had called for bandh, locals said the circumstances of her death seem suspicious — while Shaista Begum was burnt to death, all others in the house escaped unhurt. Moreover, they said, the deceased was rushed to hospital by neighbours, and not her in-laws.</p>
<p>“Our protest is to show solidarity with parents and relatives of the deceased, who have come from Bounjwan,” said Sajjad Wani, a protester, alleging that the young woman was killed.</p>
<p>The blockade continued till afternoon, creating a bottleneck. The protesters withdrew the hold-up only after senior police officers reached the spot and assured them of action against the accused.</p>

<p>“The Naxalites have been unkind to the very people who have served them. They are killing them under the suspicion that they were involved in anti-party activities,” the note said.</p>
<p>Asked how the rebels could could continue killing people despite the police claiming to have marginalised them, SP Sandip Patil said, “These killings are happening in areas where we have been successful in marginalising them. The rebels are frustrated. We have intelligence inputs that the they have decided to kill at least one person from each of their 10 area committees in the district, suspecting them to be police informers.”</p>
<p>It is learnt that police is spending large amounts to get tip-offs on the Maoists. Patil said, “The Naxals have admitted in their documents that they are no more in a position to launch big attacks on security forces. So, they have decided to launch hit-and-run attacks on policemen.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778551&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Returning to Bellary following job interviews at a firm in Bengaluru, eight women died, along with the driver of their vehicle, in an accident on National Highway 150A near Challakere in Chitradurga district in the early hours of Saturday.</p>
<p>While the driver and five students died on the spot, three other women succumbed to injuries at hospitals later, Superintendent of Police, Chitradurga, M N Anucheth, said. He said the accident occurred around 3.30 am, when the vehicle they were travelling in (a Tax Cruiser from Force Motors) was caught — and crushed — between two buses.</p>
<p>The vehicle, it appears, was trying to overtake another when it went to the other lane and crashed into an incoming Karnataka state roadways bus, the police said. It was thrown to the left of the road in the impact, at which point a rushing bus coming from behind rammed into it.</p>

<p>There were 13 women and two men in the vehicle, the police said. “The bodies got stuck in the vehicle&#8230;they could be cleared only by 6 am,” SP Anucheth said. “Six people, including the driver, Chandregowda, were killed at the spot. Three others succumbed in hospital.” Challakere police are investigating the case.</p>
<p>According to Anucheth, all eight students who died were BCom students in a Bellary college. Having finished the interviews on Friday, they left Bengaluru in the night to reach Bellary, which lies around 300 km to the north of the state capital.</p>
<p>Besides the driver — Chandregowda R (25) of Bellary — the students who died on the spot are T Shanti (20) of Bagevadi, D Sudha (20) of Bagevadi, P Saritha (22) of Siraguppa, K Jayasree (22) of Siraguppa, and T Bharathi (20) of Siraguppa.</p>
<p>Another student, D Harshita (20), succumbed to injuries at Challakere Government Hospital. The eight people injured in the accident were taken to Chitradurga District Hospital, where two other students succumbed: M Shruthi (20) and Kavya (19), both residents of Bellary.</p>
<p>“Seven more injured people, including the driver of the KSRTC bus, Mohammed Hussain, are still admitted. Some of them are critical,” a police officer said.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2778026 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/mumbai-collapse1.jpg" alt="Mumbai, Mumbai bulding collapse, Grant Road, Grant Road railway station, Grant road building, Grant road Mumbai, Kamathipura Mumbai" /> Mumbai: Five people have been rescued and some are still feared trapped under the debris in R S Nimkar Marg. Source: Express photo
<p>SIX people died and two others suffered injuries after a three-storeyed building on R S Nimkar Marg in Kamathipura collapsed on Saturday. The building, named Gulmohar, was over a hundred years old and was undergoing repair work, which was being overseen by the MHADA.</p>
<p>Though the building was listed as a residential building, as per MHADA’S records no one was living in the building. MHADA officials said that there was a restaurant on the ground floor and a few embroidery workshops on the floors above.</p>
<p>Onlookers said that the building completely collapsed in a matter of minutes. “There was a loud crash and the next thing we knew, the building was gone in less than five minutes. The locals and some NGOs in the area rushed to help the people who were trapped inside,” said Moinuddin Siddique, a resident of the area.</p>
<p>A majority of the eight rescued are believed to have been construction workers who were involved in the repair work of the building. Five of those rescued were taken to JJ Hospital. The remaining three were sent to Nair Hospital. Of the five taken to JJ Hospital, 26-year old Kenolin Mullah is the only survivor. Sharful Mullah (28), Angad Chaubey (45), Wasim Mullah Khan (14) and Jabbar Mullah (30) died. Of the three taken to Nair hospital, Mohammad Jakri (50) suffered injuries and a 25-year-old male and a 50-year-old female, whose identities are still unknown, died.</p>
<p>“The people who were in the building when it collapsed include four brothers and their nephew. They had been working at the building for a month and a half and also lived there,” said Arjan Mullah, a relative of the family. Two members of the family, Jabbar Mullah and Sharful Mullah, are now dead. All of them hail from Murshidabad in Kolkata and migrated between the cities to earn for their families back home.</p>
<p>Despite being over a hundred years old, the building, as per MHADA’s records was not declared dilapidated. The repair work of the building was being funded by MLA Amin Patel who has raised questions over the inspection of the building by the MHADA officials. “If an engineer is not able to determine whether a building is dilapidated or not, what kind of an inspection is being carried out? A probe will be carried out and the persons responsible for this will be penalised,” said Patel.</p>
<p>The work order for the repair work of Gulmohar building, which was supposed to continue for the next eight months, was issued on April 28 at a cost of at least Rs 2.73 lakh.</p>
<p>For the safety of the residents of the adjacent building which may have suffered structural changes, the MHADA evacuated them and will be shifting them to transit camps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

(Source: ANI)
<p>The MHADA insisted that the building did not show any cracks or signs of being in a dangerous condition. “We had conducted a visual inspection of the building and had not found the building to be dilapidated. The building had a conventional structure with load bearing walls and wooden beams. There were no signs of the building being dilapidated,” said Sanjay Jadhav, the in-charge executive engineer of MHADA.</p>
<p>The MHADA officials said that the inquiry would look into other causes which could have led to the building collapse. “The construction of a road was going on, in front of the building. We will have to see if the drilling or excavation could have possibly led to the collapse of the building,” said Jadhav.</p>
<p>The BMC officials, however, dismissed the idea and said</p>
<p>that the road work could not have impacted the building in any manner.</p>
<p>“The work of concretisation of the road started from April 19 and the contractor used JCB to excavate the road. Also after April 22, no excavation was carried out.</p>

<p>The MHADA was responsible for the repair work of the building and are simply trying to put the blame on the BMC,” said an official from the E ward, requesting anonymity.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777873&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2778525" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/punjab-759.jpg" alt="Punjab, Punjab polls, Punjab gangster, Jaswinder Singh, Rocky, gangster, gangster murder, Punjab gangster murder, gangster murder news, punjab news, india news" /> Rocky, facing several criminal cases, had unsuccessfully contested 2012 Punjab polls as an Independent candidate
<p>Shortly after Rocky was shot dead in Parwanoo, the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/facebook/">Facebook</a> profiles of his rival gangsters were abuzz with updates, some even posting pictures of his body and the blood-stained vehicle. These gangsters are currently lodged in jails across Punjab, where cellphones are not allowed.</p>
<p>Just four hours after the attack, Vicky Gounder, lodged in Nabha High Security jail, updated his status. The post mentioned that Rocky was killed to avenge Shera Khubban’s death. Khubban was a noted gangster who was gunned down by Punjab Police around four years ago.</p>
<p>Also, the Facebook profiles of gangsters Ranjodh Singh Jodhan, Deep Sandhu, Gurpreet Sekhon and Harshit Jindal, all of whom are presently lodged in Nabha and Patiala jails, welcomed Rocky’s murder.</p>
<p>Bathinda SSP Swapan Sharma said investigations by Punjab Police indicated that a Ferozepur-based gang led by gangster Jaipal could be behind Rocky’s murder.</p>

<p>“Jaipal is wanted in a number of cases. He has been absconding for a few years now. We suspect that his gang is behind the murder. It is battle of supremacy. We will finish all such gangs,” Sharma told The Sunday Express. “The gangs in Punjab are area-specific and they always try to outdo each other to establish their supremacy,” he said.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Gounder’s Facebook post also targeted SSP Sharma, calling him Rocky’s friend. “Bathinda SSP Swapan Sharma CIA Bathinda ch mnu kehnda c mitti vich let par main Rocky de yaar Swapan Sharma nu keha c k mein dsu jdo Rocky nu mitti ch lataya&#8230;. Aah Hunda asli latena—- SSP Swapan Sharma. (Bathinda SSP Swapan Sharma was asking me to lay in mud in the CIA branch, but I told Rocky’s friend Swapan Sharma that I will tell when I will lay Rocky in mud. This is the real laying &#8211; SSP Swapan Sharma).”</p>
<p>SSP Sharma said, “We will question Gounder on the Facebook post.”</p>

Amit Chakravarty
<p>Setting aside political differences, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis shared a public stage on Saturday to show their unity.</p>
<p>At the inauguration of the Goregaon bridge, named after Janata Dal leader Mrunal Gore, Fadnavis said, “Uddhav Thackeray is a great support and guide. Together, we will change the face of Mumbai and Maharashtra through development work.”</p>

<p>However at the function, the Sena and the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> tried to display their might with a large number of workers from the respective parties holding up their respective flags.</p>
<p>During his speech, referring to BJP minister Vidhay Thakur’s demand that the bridge should be named as Ram Pool, Thackeray said, “ We want Ram temple at Ayodhya. But the name of Goregaon bridge as Mrunal Gore is very apt.”</p>
<p>Supporting Thackeray, Fadnavis said, “I must appreciate the BMC for considering late Mrunal Gore’s work and naming the bridge after her. This was the right decision.”</p>
<p>Earlier in his speech, Fadnavis also said, “The government is determined to open up the land parcel to create affordable housing. Our government is committed to give houses to mill workers. Today, houses are unaffordable due to constraints of space.” Citing the Singapore model, he said, “If we level the land prices, we can bring down the cost of houses in Mumbai and make it within the reach of ordinary citizens.”</p>

<p>Gangster-turned-politician Jaswinder Singh aka ‘Rocky,’ 50, was shot dead by unidentified assailants on Panchkula-Shimla national highway Saturday. Police suspect the incident is the fallout of a gang war.</p>
<p>According to preliminary probe, Rocky and his driver were travelling from Himachal Pradesh to Chandigarh. Around 9.45 am, at least two armed men opened fire at his SUV at a traffic signal in Parwanoo, Haryana.</p>
<p>While Rocky died on the spot, his driver Parampal Singh suffered serious injuries. Parampal was rushed to PGIMER, Chandigarh, and is stable, said police.</p>
<p>Rocky, who was facing several criminal cases, had unsuccessfully contested the 2012 Punjab polls as an Independent candidate from Fazilka.</p>

<p>IGP (South), Himachal Pradesh, Zahoor Haider Zaidi told The Sunday Express, “SP (Solan) Anjum Ara visited the spot. We are coordinating with Punjab Police. The assailants will be nabbed soon.”</p>
<p>According to Punjab Intelligence officials, Rocky’s aide and driver Parampal Singh has given them a lead regarding the assailants. “He has said the assailants were gang members of Jaipal and Tirath, who are wanted in several cases,” an intelligence official said, adding that Jaipal allegedly heads a gang of highway robbers and is wanted in many states.</p>
<p>“Jaipal, who hails from Ferozepur, is presently at large. He had an old enmity with Rocky. It is a case of gang war. Palla added that Rocky was under threat to his life from the Jaipal and Tirath gangs,” said a senior Himachal Pradesh police officer.</p>
<p>Rocky had been allegedly associated with many senior politicians of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. He had hit the headlines in 2008 when his name cropped up in connection with the alleged murder of another gangster, Prabhjinder Singh Dimpy, outside Lake Club in Chandigarh.</p>

<p>Arijit Pasayat, vice-chairman of the SIT on black money, said Saturday that his team was in the initial stages of probing the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/panama-papers/">Panama Papers</a> leak and was ascertaining how many of the entities were illegitimate.</p>
<p>“It is a challenge. First thing is to ascertain how many of these companies are legitimate. Then the next stage of the probe will begin. The verification itself takes a lot of time,” Pasayat said on the sidelines of an ED function.</p>

<p>He added that cross-border transactions pose a challenge, especially with money being parked in tax havens. Since these destinations are not very cooperative in sharing information, he said, the task becomes more difficult.</p>
<p>“These are multi-layered complex transactions. Countries blacklisted by Financial Action Task Force are still uncooperative. But you have to lift the corporate veil some time&#8230; Thankfully, due to international pressure, some of the tax havens have begun sharing information. Panama too, we hope, will share information,” he said.</p>
<p>During his speech at the function, Pasayat raised the issue of shell companies. He said, “We had asked registrar of companies for information on the same people being directors in various companies. We were informed that 97,000 people are directors in more than 20 companies. There are 2,000 people who are directors in more than 100 companies. We found small rooms in Kolkata and Delhi which were offices of more than 20 companies.”</p>
<p>Pasayat said that to break through such a maze of companies, coordination between various agencies and sharing of database was important.</p>
<p>ED Director Karnal Singh too raised the issue in his speech. Hinting that various agencies working on the same case do not share information with ED, Singh said, “Every agency thinks it is the prime agency and thus would not like to share information. All agencies have data but don’t share on the pretext of it being misused. Proper checks can be put in place. But not sharing information hampers the probe.”</p>
<p>ED and CBI are probing several cases together, including the AgustaWestland chopper case.</p>
<p>Singh said that the ED had so far attached properties worth over Rs 11,000 crore with Rs 2,000 crore worth attachments being done last year alone.</p>
<p>He, however, raised the issue of the inability of the agency to maintain running businesses, such as factories, after attachment. The agency has sent a proposal to the department of revenue to make separate body for maintaining such properties. Sources said the proposal is being considered by the ministry.</p>

<p>The first priority will be to create linkages of finance by overcoming physical barriers which will help in integrating the state with rest of the country and empowering young local entrepreneurs,’’ he said.</p>
<p>We are taking measurable short-term initiatives,’’ he said, adding that J&amp;K is in a better position in making the state easy for financing, which can be a model for rest of the country to emulate’’.</p>
<p>Rajan stressed on branding of handicraft products by popularising logos and bringing tour operators, hoteliers and other stakeholders under one platform to aggressively promote Jammu Kashmir as a niche high-end tourist destination.</p>
<p>Chief Secretary B R Sharma, Principal Secretary to chief minister, Navin K Chaudhary who also holds charge of finance department, besides regional director RBI Damrudhar Sethi along with chief general manager and executive assistant to RBI governor Vivek Agarwal also attended the meeting. Urging the RBI to reach out to state’s young and budding entrepreneurs by helping them establish viable business units, chief minister expected the RBI to do more in exerting pressure on banking firms in the state so that small and medium entrepreneurs have hassle free access to loans. She asked the premier financial institutions to broaden the scope of their business operations, adding that banks need to focus on priority sector lending in the state especially targeting tourism, handicraft, handloom, agriculture and allied segments.</p>
<p>Saying that state’s economy needs resuscitation as it has gone through very difficult times, she said we need to achieve RBI benchmark of 60 per cent credit deposit ratio for which banks have to scale up lending’’. The CM requested Rajan to expedite working out modalities for establishing banking facilities for cross LoC trade.</p>

<p>“In Eastern UP, majority of BPL category people are Dalits and those belonging to backward castes. Hence, launching of PMUY holds a political significance for <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> ahead of UP polls next year,” said a BJP leader.</p>
<p>The PM will return to Varanasi the same evening, and address a gathering of nearly 10,000 boatmen at Assi Ghat and distribute 11 solar-powered “e-boats”. These boatmen mostly belong to the ‘Mallah’ community, which comes under most backward castes (MBCs).</p>
<p>Before launching the e-boats, Modi will meet 100 prominent people from the district to discuss about the development of Varanasi. Later, he will distribute 1,000 e-rickshaws and also hold a chaupal with rickshawpullers.</p>
<p>The PM will then visit ‘Gyan Prawah’, a religious place near Ganga. He will leave for Delhi late evening.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Telecom Commission on Saturday cleared a proposal to offer a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) employees who are 50 years of age and above, to save costs, a senior government official said, adding that nearly 80 per cent of MTNL’s expenses are towards staff costs.</p>
<p>“The exchequer can save around Rs 500 crore to Rs 600 crore every year by giving VRS to some MTNL employees. It can earn up to Rs 300 crore every year from its assets such as buildings and towers by renting them out,” the official said.</p>
<p>The official said the government would spend around Rs 2,000 crore towards the VRS. Of this, Rs 1,000 crore will be spent by the Centre towards ex-gratia payment to the employees and the rest will be on account of other settlements.</p>
<p>MTNL has over 40,000 employees, 26,000 of whom will be retiring in the next 10 years. The official said that the government plans to save costs by giving the VRS option to 20 per cent of its employees who are above 50 years of age, which is around 5,312 staffers.</p>
<p>The VRS proposal, to which the unions are also in agreement with, will go to the Cabinet for approval during this month itself, the official said.</p>
<p>To further revive MTNL, the official said that the telecom panel has cleared the PSU’s plan to bid for Delhi government’s tender, as per which security cameras will be set up across the city. This is on lines of Mumbai’s plan to increase vigilance in the metro city.</p>
<p>As of date, the official informed that Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd had a negative net worth of Rs 500 crore and was incurring losses of Rs 2,000 crore per year. The proceeds, from savings made on back of the VRS plan, will not be spent towards hiring more employees, but towards setting up more effective infrastructure.</p>

<p>The Telecom Commission has deferred taking a call on the proposal of having a uniform spectrum usage charge, and will seek opinions from the Attorney General of India and a technical committee for arriving at a final decision, a senior government official said.</p>

<p>“The DoT is of the view that SUC should be uniform at a revenue-neutral rate of 4.5 per cent (of a company’s adjusted gross revenue), especially in times of LTE, when there is a scope of carrier aggregation,” the official said.</p>
<p>As against the DoT view of 4.5 per cent, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Tari) has suggested that the SUC be kept uniform at 3 per cent of AGR.</p>
<p>The Cellular Operators Association of India, which represents the likes of Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular, Vodafone India, has spoken in favour of a uniform rate but has also sought an eventual reduction of SUC to 1 per cent.</p>
<p>Further explaining the motive to have a uniform rate, the official said that there are several bands a telecom operator uses to deploy <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/4g/">4G</a> LTE services.</p>
<p>At the time of paying the SUC, it can calculate the charge based on which band has the lowest rate, thus causing a loss to the exchequer. The move to have a uniform SUC rate reduced chances of such arbitrage.</p>
<p>“The Telecom Commission felt that it should take into account the report of a DoT technical committee on whether there should be a uniform rate or not, along with a legal opinion from the Attorney General or the Solicitor General, before taking the final call,” the official said.</p>
<p>The official also explained that the issue was a key one, and a decision would be taken in time to keep the spectrum auctions on track as SUC is one of the important parts of the Notice Inviting Applications for the spectrum auctions.</p>

<p>Four policemen were injured in a clash between two communities at a village in Saharanpur district after a statue of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar was found smeared with black paint Friday evening. The incident took place at Gharkoli village where violent clashes broke out between the Dalit community and the Thakur community, the former accusing the latter of blackening Ambedkar’s statue.</p>
<p>As a police team reached the spot to control the situation, the villagers began to attack them too, leaving Deputy Superintendent of Police Anand Pandey, Sub-Divisional Magistrate Ram Vilas, and Sub-Inspectors Brijesh Kumar and B B Sharma seriously injured.</p>
<p>Brijesh, who is also the Station Officer of Fatehpur police station, and Sharma, who sustained severe head injuries, are undergoing treatment at the district hospital. Eight persons were arrested in connection with the incident on Saturday. They were produced before a local court which sent them to judicial custody, said Station Officer of Gagalherhi police station, Narender Sharma.</p>

<p>Circle Officer of Sadar area Anand Pandey, who was injured in the clash, said tension was sparked on Thursday when the Dalits put up a signboard at the entry point of Gharkoli, in which they renamed the village as “The Great Chamar Gharkoli”.</p>
<p>As the Thakur community objected to the signboard, a consensus was reached between the two groups on Friday morning in presence of police and the board was blackened, Pandey said.</p>
<p>The same evening, members of the Dalit community came to know that the statue of Ambedkar placed at the main crossing of the village has been painted black. Both the communities gathered there and began hurling accusations at each other. Soon the argument turned into a scuffle as they indulged in brick-batting, the CO said.</p>
<p>Hearing about the clash, a police team led by Pandey and SDM Vilas rushed to the spot and tried to bring the situation under control. The mob then targeted the police team and started pelting them with stones. Later, another team of senior police officials reached the village and lathi-charged the agitators to restore peace. Heavy police force have been deployed to avoid any untoward incident.</p>

<p>The Telecom Commission has granted its approval to auctioning of all available spectrum across all frequencies at reserve prices as recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), including that in the contentious 700 MHz band, a senior government official said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Auction of the 700 MHz band was under debate after the industry had suggested that only a part of the available spectrum was put under the hammer, but the sectoral regulator favoured auctioning the entire slot of 35 MHz of paired spectrum. The Telecom Commission on March 28 had referenced back the regulator’s recommendations seeking clarifications on some issues.</p>

<p>The Department of Telecom (DoT) had asked Trai to reconsider its recommendation on auctioning the entire available quantity in the 700 MHz band. In its clarifications, Trai said the government was exploring option to auction 40 MHz in the first phase and 30 MHz in the second phase.</p>
<p>Trai reiterated its view suggesting that the all the spectrum available in the frequency should be put to auction, which is planned in July.</p>
<p>The government official said that the commission was of the view that all the 35 MHz paired spectrum in the 700 MHz band should be auctioned at a base price of Rs 57,500 crore per block. One block is equal to 5 MHz of the natural resource.</p>
<p>Another proposal that the panel cleared was change in payment terms for spectrum won in auction. Even as the conditions for sub-1 GHz bands — 700 MHz, 800 MHz, and 900 MHz — were unchanged, the government increased the upfront payment for spectrum in 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, and 2500 MHz bands.</p>
<p>In the auctions held till date, telecom companies paid an upfront amount of 33 per cent with the rest payable in instalments, whereas according to the new policy, they would have to pay 50 per cent of the winning amount up front.</p>
<p>“Those who buy spectrum in bands above 1 GHz, have the capacity to borrow and pay,” the official said, explaining the rationale behind the decision. The official also said that the government expected harmonisation of defence spectrum in time for the July auctions that would release up to 200 MHz spectrum for use by mobile companies.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2778450" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/tina-brown-759.jpg" alt="Author and journalist Tina Brown (right) with Deputy Editor Shalini Langer at The Indian Express office. Amit Mehra" /> Author and journalist Tina Brown (right) with Deputy Editor Shalini Langer at <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> office. Amit Mehra
<p><em><strong><span style="color:red;">Shalini Langer:</span> Spotlight won the Oscar for the best film this year. It celebrated the kind of journalism where you put in almost a year’s work into a story. You have often faced criticism for running up expenses while chasing a story that may or may not materialise. At a time when everyone is chasing ‘breaking news’, do you think there is still space for that kind of journalism?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think it is a tragedy. The digital medium has blown up the economic model to the point that long form and investigative journalism are getting very little space. I think Spotlight did well not only because it is a good film, but because there is a hunger, people want it (such content). At the same time, someone is going to have to pay for it, and people don’t seem to want to pay for it.</p>
<p>There is some very good investigative journalism happening in America. There is ProPublica and there are websites such as The Marshall Project, which are doing great stuff, but it is a needle in a haystack. You can’t really find it, it appears, it’s excellent, it might get picked up, but it doesn’t have that institutional pressure, that of having come from a source that everybody is reading. It is not just about investigative journalism and paying for such content. It is also about getting attention for it (an investigative story) once it is published. So, there is also the problem of not having people to read it. I am a little pessimistic about the situation.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color:red;">Shalini Langer:</span> So how do you get somebody to read these kind of stories? Does it also require support from other media outlets?</em></strong></p>
<p>I have always thought editing is about seduction. I think everything is the enemy of the piece that I want someone to read. When I took over The New Yorker (1992-98), people would say, ‘I loved it. I have it in the lock basket next to my bed’. I have always thought that’s a terrible sign. It suggests that people meant to read it have not read it.</p>
<p>It’s very important for newspapers to do things. It is an important battle. You are already battling the iPhone. Having moved now into live media, I have exactly the same philosophy. We do live media summits — Women in the World Summit, American Justice Summit — and we programme it absolutely like I did a magazine, which is all about getting people hooked on to something that they will be interested in. That is how they would end up watching things that they would have never watched.</p>
<p>We keep it very fast paced. We use very intense video and keep them (the audience) captive in their seats because of the mixed pace and the selling that we do for each of the discussions, as if it was an article, had headlines, photographs etc.</p>
<p>We work constantly on the seduction point and I think unless you do that, you are doomed, you just cannot get attention. You have to give a lot of attention to everything that you are publishing — headlines, blurbs, content.</p>

<p><em><strong><span style="color:red;">Maneesh Chhibber:</span> At a time when everyone carrying a smart phone is a virtual editor, what do you think are the problems confronting an actual editor?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think what is very difficult, and I’m very emphatic to reporters about it, is the endless pressure to post before you are ready. When the story is half-baked and you haven’t got it&#8230; It is a very difficult thing. Online, it is very difficult to get depth, you have to be very fast. But on the other hand, these online platforms have reach, and when it works and goes viral, it is so exhilarating because you can make a huge impact.</p>
<p>I’m sure you read about the Rolling Stone (case). When Rolling Stone published this huge, hot and heavy piece about rape (an article published in the November 19, 2014, issue of Rolling Stone, which described an alleged group sexual assault at the University of Virginia), the source, it turned out, had totally made up the whole thing. Basic things had to be checked in the case. The reporter did not even check if there was a fraternity party that night, in that place (mentioned by the source). There were so many awful red herrings. They did not do the basic things and that can destroy a magazine. Rolling Stone was really hurt by that and it took away a huge chunk of their credibility.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color:red;">Maneesh Chhibber:</span> In recent times, both in India and the US, the editor is facing a big challenge, that of politicians not speaking with you unless you are on their side. How do you deal with that?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is a very difficult problem and television is most vulnerable to it. If they don’t have a guest, they have an empty chair. We have this problem constantly. Certain people refuse to turn up, don’t want to participate if they don’t have the questions they want. Then there is no show. The journalist does not get any marks for that in his own company because he becomes the guy who failed to get the guest. Actually Fox’s (news channel) moderation of the debates, for all the criticism that they get, is the best. Megyn Kelly, this very good new anchor, has been asking some very, very tough questions.</p>
<p>In print, you have better leverage because at least you can go to multiple sources and get stories. You can still have a story, create a profile of someone if he doesn’t cooperate. But in television, it is impossible.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color:red;">Vandita Mishra:</span> What are the challenges that someone like Donald Trump poses for the editor in America today?</strong></em></p>
<p>I don’t think editors see it as a challenge. He gets glorious free media, he has spent the least on advertising because he gets so much coverage. Television just loves him because of the ratings. He doesn’t bother much with print because for him, it is a waste of time. There is a bit of more soul-searching now about it because there is a sudden realisation that this guy is winning state after state and could end up with a nomination, and I think the ‘Stop Trump’ movement is gaining momentum.</p>
<p>The challenges are to keep on fact-checking him, and finding new ways to shock people. The Daily Beast did an excellent piece (July 2015) on how the Trump Tower was built by a huge bunch of Polish immigrant workers. I had thought then this was great, the piece was terrific and it would ruin Trump. But surprisingly, it did not get any attention. I didn’t understand why.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:red;"><em>Shailaja Bajpai:</em></span> Would you say that the media actually has the power to make or break someone like Donald Trump? </strong></p>
<p>He has gotten this far because he tells so many lies. The interesting thing is that a straight politician would be brought down by so many lies. I think Trump will just be brought down with a self-inflicted wound that even he can’t walk away from.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color:red;">Shailaja Bajpai:</span> If indeed it is Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump in the final race to the White House, what in your opinion will be the outcome? </strong></em></p>
<p>Actually it looks good for Hillary Clinton (candidate for the Democratic nomination for US President), because Trump is only popular with some crazy primary voters. If you look at Republicans overall, he has really high negatives. The Republicans are in a state of hysteria because of what they have done to themselves. The truth is, it is all their fault. They are finally understanding that they committed suicide. So it looks good for Hillary in that sense. But she has very high negatives too. She may even get some moderate Republicans (to vote for her). The danger could only be if the Bernie Sanders (candidate for the Democratic nomination for US President) supporters decide to sit this one out as a protest.</p>
<p>Hillary is doing well at the moment. She is keeping steady. She has had some reverses, the white men now don’t like her, and young people don’t like her. It is tough being Hillary. She deserves (the nomination). When you see what she is up against, it is quite frightening.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color:red;">Shalini Langer:</span> There have been comparisons made between Donald Trump and Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a>, on how they prefer social media for interactions, instead of traditional interviews. Do you see any parallels? </strong></em></p>
<p>Aside from the mastery of Twitter — though Trump’s tweets are totally misspelt — I don’t really see any parallels, because I think Modi is fiercely intelligent, he reads everything, he is a huge devourer of information. That is not true of Donald Trump. The only thing he really watches is this morning talk show, Morning Joe, which is slightly fashionable because 3,000 people watch it. The only knowledge of foreign affairs that he has is from 10 minutes on the treadmill when he looks at a little bit of Morning Joe. So when he was asked who would he make his secretary of state, he said, ‘Richard Haass (American diplomat ) would be great, that very smart guy on Morning Joe and that guy Waleed’. I figured out he must have meant Fareed Zakaria, host of CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS. Which is the other thing that he watches for two minutes. So I texted Richard Haass saying, ‘You have very serious competition from Waleed’.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color:red;">Shailaja Bajpai:</span> You have spent a considerable part of your career in magazines. Do you think magazine journalism is in danger, and what did it bring to the table that we have lost?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is very difficult for magazines. I still think most magazines have a role. The New Yorker is one that is still alive. Atlanta has done a very good job. They consistently get pieces that enter the conversation and are sustained in debates. As a magazine junkie all my life and a creator of them, unfortunately I very rarely buy them. It is all on my phone. I hear about an article and I read it online. It is a shame because I miss the emotion in print and one of the things that I find frustrating in online journalism sometimes is that it has to be in a format. But in magazines, you can have emotion and drama, in newspapers too. You have the big splash; it is like today it (this news) is important, so it looks different from tomorrow, and so there is a huge picture (on the page). But tomorrow there isn’t a huge picture, there is a spread or there isn’t. So you can respond and bring the emotion and seduction of the feeling to the layout, which you cannot do online. I used to find it so frustrating to have to be stuck with the same format. You can’t suddenly blow a photograph up. That is frustrating.</p>
<p>The Indian newspaper culture is still very vibrant. I feel that there is a lot of pressure to only be digital (in America).</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color:red;">Monojit Majumdar:</span> Do you think you would have been the journalist that you are if you had not edited magazines like The New Yorker?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, I think an editor is always changed by the title that he edits. I mean, if you take on a tabloid title, you will be marinated in that and it will change you even if you weren’t like that in the beginning. I left Vanity Fair (1984–1992) because I wanted to up my game more and taking on The New Yorker was a different kind of challenge. Then to go to digital journalism was another kind of sharpening of skills. It is very important to keep on sharpening and putting yourself out of your comfort zone to a new place where you are being challenged in different ways. I grew by doing this.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color:red;">Shalini Langer:</span> Do you think Michelle Obama would make a good presidential candidate a few years down the line?</strong> </em></p>
<p>I think she (Michelle) is a powerful communicator. I can’t see her having a political career. I think she might develop&#8230; They (Michelle and <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a>) are both young and I feel they both haven’t had a chance to do something that they really wanted to do, to sort of work with underprivileged African American youths. She (Michelle) has hated the White House so much. Being the first lady is a pretty tough job. You got to be perfect.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color:red;">Apurva:</span> Recently we had the JNU controversy, where a couple of students were charged with <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/what-is-section-124-a-under-which-one-is-charged-with-sedition/">sedition</a>. This is spreading to a couple of other universities too in India. Are there limits to speech and action in American universities?</em></strong></p>
<p>We have completely different problems. For instance, having to rename everything because it might offend or trigger certain emotional traumatic experiences. If you have a name of someone who was connected to slavery or connected to misogyny&#8230; All this is really going to make history a very tough sell because what can you call yourselves anymore that is pure and free of any kind of stench or bad feeling? In a way that is just the kind of political correctness on a binge, and it will self-correct, which is a great thing about America. So it is a very good thing that in the US, you can say pretty much what you like. The digital sound byte though has gotten people very, very scared because it just bites you ferociously and you can have your career ended by the wrong sound byte.</p>
<p>Sedition just seems to be a complete mistake as an idea. I am amazed that it can’t be changed, the law of sedition.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color:red;">Ayushman Basu:</span> At the Women in the World Summit last November, you said that the gender discourse in India is very exciting.</strong> </em></p>
<p>I think that there has always been tremendous violence against women in India, but the important thing is that people are talking about it, acting on it, willing to know about it and covering it. That to me is an exciting development because that wasn’t necessarily true in India’s past. So women in India are definitely surging ahead in many areas, are super- educated and many of them are going into these jobs that they could never do before. But there is an enormous gap between what is happening in rural India and what is happening in the cities, and that is a massive challenge that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color:red;">Apurva:</span> When this JNU incident happened, television did play a large role in ramping up sentiments across the country. They were playing a lot of videos that were apparently doctored. With easy access to cellphones, anyone can put out a video. How do you work your way around such things?</em></strong></p>
<p>I believe in hiring very credible journalists who ask questions. I am enormously sceptical and I have a certain built-in instinct that you develop that this doesn’t feel right. But really, you need to have extremely credible journalists. Which is why you cannot afford children walking around saying that this is going viral. You need some wise heads. So if you are going to say this, be sure it is right. I mean, who supplied this? You really need to ask where is it (the story) is coming from. I think that is about training.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>V S Achuthanandan, 92. M Karunanidhi, 91. What makes the oldest candidates in fray in Kerala and Tamil Nadu the most</em> sought-after by their parties? <em><strong>Shaju Philip &amp; Arun Janardhanan</strong></em> find out</p>
<p>Addressing an election rally in Assam last month, Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> dismissed the competition posed by <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, saying “he is so senior to me and, in a few years, he will be 90&#8243;. Gogoi is 81.</p>
<p>In two corresponding elections, there are two 90-plus contenders whom no one can dismiss in a hurry. If V S Achuthanandan is spearheading the CPM comeback campaign in Kerala, M Karunanidhi is doing the same for the DMK in neighbouring Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>This is Achuthanandan’s eighth Assembly election. He first contested 49 years ago, in 1967, from Ambalapuzha. In all this time, he has been chief minister just once, though few may be able to stop him should the CPM win on May 19.</p>
<img class="wp-image-2778443 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/karuna-achuta-7591.jpg" alt="karuna achuta 759" /> V S Achuthanandan and M Karunanidhi
<p>Karunanidhi is fighting his 13th Assembly election. He has not been defeated once in nearly 60 years of contesting polls, having begun from Kulitalai in 1957, and has been the CM five times. He has also been a member of the (now-abolished) Tamil Nadu Legislative Council once.</p>
<p>Achuthanandan is now the only surviving leader among the founders of the CPM. Both VS and Karunanidhi are the oldest candidates in the fray in the two states.</p>
<p>Here’s something more to put that in perspective: in the year 1957, when Karunanidhi won his first polls, Feroze Gandhi won from the Rae Bareli <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/">Lok Sabha</a> seat. 1967, when VS contested the first time, was the year the Congress fought its first general elections without Jawaharlal Nehru at the helm.</p>

<img class="size-full wp-image-2778433" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/vsachun1.jpg" alt="Wayanad: VS Achuthanandan arrives to visit the drought hit areas at Pulappalli in Wayanad on Friday.

<p>At 7.45 am, the government rest-house in Palakkad is deserted, except for a police constable lazing in a chair near a room on the ground floor. Minutes later, an elderly man emerges from the room, his mundu folded above the knees. Escorted by an assistant, he carefully climbs down a small ramp to a courtyard.</p>
<p>Here, the crimson sun of Kerala politics, Velikkakath Sankaran Achuthanandan, stands facing the sun — eyes closed, lips pursed. After a few minutes, he turns around for his back to soak in the morning rays. About 10 minutes later, he returns to his room.</p>
<p>Achuthanandan, popularly known as VS, will turn 93 in October. Before the Assembly elections of 2011, VS, who was then chief minister, had been denied a seat by the CPM “on health grounds”. After widespread discontent among party workers and the public, the CPM gave in. That election battle was reckoned to be the 87-year-old’s last. Here we are, five years later, with VS a natural contender for the CM’s post.</p>
<p>Apart from being the Left Democratic Front candidate from Malampuzha constituency, the veteran is shouldering the LDF campaign across the state — proving once again his ability to reinforce his relevance. All this doesn’t come easy. VS begins his day at 5 am. By 6 am, he is out for his regular morning walk, dressed in track pants and a white T-shirt. While at his official residence in Thiruvananthapuram, he usually goes to the university stadium for a half-an-hour walk, but now that he is in Palakkad district for campaigning, he makes do with the tarred road near the rest-house. As VS walks, two aides keep a careful watch, with one of them showing the way with a torch. VS walks for about 50 metres, taking slow, measured steps, then turns around and walks back. His assistant Kunhikannan says he walks this way for nearly 20 minutes, without exchanging a word with his aides.</p>
<p>After the walk, VS rests in his room for a while. “This is when he reads the newspapers. He wants all the local Malayalam and English dailies on his table when he returns from his walk,” says Kunhikkannan, who has been with VS for four years. This is followed by a bath and a 20-minute-long yoga session. VS took to yoga 12 years ago and does his asanas without anyone’s help, says Kunhikkannan. It is after yoga that he soaks up the sun.</p>

<p>Breakfast comes next. His aides say VS flips through newspapers as he eats his usual “steam-baked puttu or idiyappam or appam”. VS’s fitness at 92 is attributed in part to his diet regimen: No tea or coffee for him; he only drinks hot water or tender coconut water. He has also largely stuck to vegetarian food, though he occasionally eats fish curry. A couple of years ago, VS famously broke this regimen when he went to greet estranged comrade, K R Gouri, on her birthday. Gouri is said to have chided him, “Since when have you turned vegetarian?”, and forced him to eat fish curry.</p>
<p>By 9 am, the veteran CPM leader is ready to receive visitors. Local leaders start trickling in, including A Prabhakaran, the LDF election committee convenor of Malampuzha constituency. Prabhakaran briefs him about the day’s schedule and tells him he will have to attend a few panchayat-level CPM conventions.</p>
<p>“I have been coordinating Achuthanandan’s election in Malampuzha since 2001. This time too he will win with a thumping majority,” says Prabhakaran. In 2011, VS had won by 20,017 votes against Congress candidate Lathika Subhash.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, VS is ready to leave for the first convention. Two assistants help him into a car, which sports the party flag on its bonnet. As he sinks into his seat, VS slips into the past: of those days without cars, with a lot of ground to be covered on foot. He started out as a strident labour union leader in Alappuzha who went on to become one of the most popular faces of the CPM in Kerala.</p>
<p>“I became a member of the Communist party in 1940, at the age of 17. I worked among fishermen, toddy-tappers and coconut climbers in Alappuzha. I later joined a coir factory, organised workers there and brought them closer to the Communist movement,” he says.</p>
<p>There were tough days. “In the early 1940s, I would stay in a house at Cherukara in Alappuzha for party work. The house was located in a paddy field with streams. I would walk kilometres along narrow ridges to reach workers. There were no bridges across these streams, only wooden planks,” he says. It was in the late 1950s, when he was district secretary of the united CPI in Alappuzha, that his office got its first car.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2778435" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/dsc_0016.jpg" alt="DSC_0016" width="759" height="422" /></p>
<p>The VS motorcade reaches Kodumbu, 6 km from Palakkad city. The town is decorated with flags and festoons. Hundreds of party workers have gathered at the community hall to hear him. The hall erupts as party workers push to catch a glimpse of the veteran and shout slogans hailing him. VS has to jostle through the crowd to reach the stage, helped by his security guards. As mobile phones go up one by one to record his speech, the 92-year-old greets the audience with folded hands and starts speaking. With his voice ringing through the hall in his famous, much-mimicked style —halting and winding — the years fall away.</p>
<p>“We want to bring back the previous LDF government, which implemented several welfare initiatives,&#8221; says Achuthanandan. “You can realise my responsibility. I have to campaign across the state for LDF candidates, it is your duty to seek votes for Achuthanandan. Think of yourself as V S Achuthanandan when you go campaigning. Thank you, namaskaram.”</p>
<p>There is fresh sloganeering as VS makes his way back to his car. The next convention is at Mundur, half an hour away. At Mundur too, hundreds of party workers, including women, have been waiting for Achuthanandan. “Kanne Karale Viyesse (loosely translated to ‘Our eyes, our heart, oh VS’),” they shout as the CPM leader reaches.</p>
<p>Prabhakaran addresses the crowd here, and makes no effort to hide the ambition of the VS camp should he win. “People of Kerala are looking at VS with great expectation and enthusiasm. If an LDF government led by VS does not come to power, Kerala will collapse,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>When it’s his turn to address the gathering, VS again tells the party workers to “go to the voters as VS” and garner votes for him. It’s midday by the time the event at Mundur is over, and VS returns to the guest-house in Palakkad for lunch.</p>
<p>“A few spoons of rice and vegetables make his lunch,” says son V A Arun Kumar. What he misses while he is out campaigning is the buttermilk made from goat milk that he has without fail while in Thiruvananthapuram. “He has a goat at his official residence in the capital,” says VS’s additional private secretary K V Sudhakaran.<br />
After lunch, VS rests until 3 pm. He then meets visitors before leaving for a second round of campaigning in the evening.</p>
<p>Human rights activist Joy Kaitharam has brought along a few guests, including Lakshmi Bhai, the widow of P Satheendra Kumar, an employee of Malabar Cements who died under mysterious circumstances in 2013. The moment Kaitharam introduces Lakshmi to VS, he says, “Oh the Malabar cements case!’’ He promises Lakshmi her demand for a job for her son would be met if the LDF government came to power.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2778434" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/dsc_0076.jpg" alt="DSC_0076" width="759" height="422" /></p>
<p>VS grasps things fast, Kaitharam smiles. “If we give written material, he gets the points in one reading.” A Suresh, the personal assistant for VS for 12 years, says the veteran’s popularity can be attributed to this quality and the causes he identifies himself with: “social evils, corruption, land encroachment and sex mafia”. “He patiently hears out everyone who meets him. VS is quick to grasp an issue and understand its gravity.”</p>
<p>CPM central committee member Thomas Issac underlines what VS means for the party. “People, particularly the poor, easily identify with him. There is a huge demand from the party and the public to include VS in as many campaigns as possible.”</p>
<p>Around 4 pm, VS leaves for two more meetings in his constituency, returning around 7.30 pm to the guest-house.<br />
Before turning in for the night, VS again goes for a walk, this time for 30 minutes. “Even after a long journey or a busy schedule, he does not skip this routine. During the last Lok Sabha elections, he once stayed on the third floor of a hotel in Malappuram which did not have a lift. He would walk down the steps, come down for his evening walk and again take all those stairs on his way up,” says Sudhakaran, his additional private secretary.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2778426" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/speech-mathrubhumi.jpg" alt="speech mathrubhumi" width="759" height="422" /></p>
<p>Dinner is light — a few pieces of papaya and three or four kadali bananas. Most days, he is in bed by 9 pm. Son Arun Kumar says VS usually never discusses politics with family. “Controversies do not upset him. His initial years of struggle have given him the strength to stay like a rock when political storms hit him.”</p>
<p>He is travelling with his father this time because of his age, Kumar adds. “I am here just to monitor his food.”<br />
So what keeps him going at 92? VS, who since last fortnight has also joined social media, smiles, “I do my best to remain fit. I have a strict and disciplined life, just like my clean political life.”</p>
<p><em><strong>The perpetual rebel</strong></em></p>
<p>* Born on October 20, 1923, in Punnapra village in Alappuzha district, V S Achuthanandan lost his parents early. When 12, he dropped out of school and started working at his elder brother’s tailoring shop. He joined the Congress when he was 15, but became a CPI member two years later.</p>
<p>* In 1964, he was one of the 32 leaders to walk out of the national council of the CPI to form the CPI(M). He is the only one of the 32 still alive.</p>
<p>* VS’s biggest strength has been his ability to reinvent himself at crucial moments. As Opposition leader from 2001 to 2006, he associated himself with issues such as women’s empowerment, Dalit rights and land encroachment, which sent his popularity soaring.</p>
<p>* Within the party though, he has been a perpetual rebel, locking horns with Pinarayi Vijayan over control of the state leadership. In 2007, VS and Vijayan were both suspended from the Politburo for some time.</p>
<p>* In 2015, the CPM passed a resolution against VS for his alleged anti-party activities. But his fortunes have since brightened. With the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> joining hands with Hindu Ezhava leader Vellappally Natesan, VS as an Ezhava is even more important now.</p>

<img class="size-full wp-image-2778432" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/karunanidhilatest.jpg" alt="M Karunanidhi" /> M Karunanidhi
<p>IT’S APRIL 23, three weeks to go for what is likely his final electoral battle, and M Karunanidhi is getting ready for his first poll rally. Inside the DMK chief’s two-storey house, made in the traditional Tamil style, distinctive only for the party flag atop, there is hectic activity.</p>
<p>Personal secretary K Shanmuganathan has been busy in the visitors’ section since 8.30 am. Another aide walks up and down with a phone, looking on as senior party leaders arrive and four armed commandos of the National Security Guard take positions. A sniffer dog checks Karunanidhi&#8217;s customised Toyota Alphard standing in the lobby.</p>
<p>A dozen security personnel conduct a routine drill, checking each vehicle parked on the street with metal detectors.<br />
In his trademark safari suit, Karunanidhi’s aide Shanmughanathan, who has been with the DMK chief since 1976, is turning away people seeking appointments. Others can be seen decorating the door leading to his inner house with garlands, but the freshly drawn kolam (rangoli) in front of No. 15, 4th Street, Gopalapuram, has already been smudged by the people walking in and out.</p>
<p>As media cameras wait restlessly outside for Kalaignar, as Karunanidhi is fondly called by his followers, to emerge, news comes that the DMK chief is still having his favourite breakfast — dosa and chutney.</p>
<p>Information about what the 92-year-old eats though is tough to come by. It requires a formal mail before a close aide reveals, “Minimum four coffees a day is a must. By around 11 am, he will have chicken soup or vegetable soup, before a mini-lunch. He eats a little rice for lunch. Though there are some restrictions these days, gulab jamun and cutlets are his favourites.”</p>
<p>Around 9.30 am, eldest daughter Selvi is the first to step out, her hands full of flowers. Next to Karunanidhi’s house, in a narrow lane, is a temple. Rivals say the famously atheist leader’s family conducts pujas there. His loyalists insist Karunanidhi stops for no one, not even god.</p>
<p>That’s saying much for a leader confined to a wheelchair since 2009, and carrying the weight of his splintered party and family on his shoulders. Apart from the frugal meals, one way that keeps him going is daily yoga at 4 am, followed by the first coffee of the day. According to a close aide, he does all the possible sitting yoga postures he can for 20 minutes. The self-declared rationalist found the middle path when he embraced yoga in 2009.</p>
<p>“He started doing yoga after he was forced to give up his morning walk, which he would do mostly inside the sprawling compound of Anna Arivalayam, his party headquarters,” says the aide.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2778425" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/karunabw1.jpg" alt="KarunaBW1" width="759" height="422" /></p>
<p>Karunanidhi finally leaves around 3 pm. He first stops at a CIT Nagar residence to pick up third wife Rajathi Ammal and daughter Kanimozhi before the convoy heads for a rally on the banks of Adyar, marking the start of a road trip that will cover half of the state’s districts and involve at least 35 rallies.</p>
<p>Since he can’t go to all the 234 constituencies, the party has planned for each rally to cover a dozen or more seats. Some of the rallies are stage events, at others, he would be delivering speeches sitting in his caravan. On the road though, he may not be able to indulge in the one leisure activity aides confess about him — watching old songs on TV, some of them from his films, others bound to be from bitter rival J Jayalalithaa’s.</p>
<p>His campaign van is a customised Force Traveller with a sliding door and a high roof, that can easily accommodate Karunanidhi’s wheelchair. He has been using similar vans for several elections now. Those who have seen and heard the Karunanidhi of old say the speech delivery is no longer as effortless, but it remains spontaneous, with the leader not referring to any paper during his 20-odd-minute addresses.</p>
<p>Instructing a youth who is part of the DMK social media team, Karunanidhi’s personal secretary Rajamanickam, who is well into his 70s, says the DMK chief knows just what to highlight from his speeches for YouTube and <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/facebook/">Facebook</a>. Karunanidhi has had own Facebook and Twitter accounts since March 2014.</p>
<p>On a Monday evening, as Karunanidhi arrives for a rally at his Thiruvarur constituency, near native village Thirukkuvalai, there are over 10,000 cheering people gathered. The sight is reassuring for a leader who many have been saying should retire.</p>
<p>He starts his speech listing the names of Tamil Nadu Congress chief EVKS Elangovan sitting next to him, other alliance leaders and the DMK’s district leaders individually, triggering an applause each time. Rajathi Ammal sits behind him, while former Union telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran, who was named in the 2G scam, is to his left and never takes his eyes off the DMK supremo. The presence of both sends a message. In the war of supremacy within the Karunanidhi clan, it is Rajathi and Kanimozhi who are by the DMK chief in this campaign. Kanimozhi too carries 2G taint, and Dayanidhi is a surprise inclusion given his absence from public view for a long time.<br />
Ignoring this fact, the DMK chief focuses on the alleged corruption of the Jayalalithaa government, talking about “money seizures” from her partymen’s houses and demanding a CBI probe.</p>
<p>If the presence of Kanimozhi is remarked upon, so is the curious absence of M K Stalin, while eldest son M K Alagiri is more or less silent now. Alagiri remains unpopular, and there is talk still among cadres and voters of him coming back if Karunanidhi returns to power. Others say how Stalin, who is running a virtual parallel campaign with professionals and a strong social media presence, should have been projected as the CM candidate by the DMK.<br />
Older leaders close to Karunanidhi say some of his own relatives have asked him to hand over the baton to Stalin. However, says a close aide, Karunanidhi doesn’t want to be a father who made his son a CM. “He follows Mao’s theory — ‘I don’t want to support anyone, let them grow on their own’.”</p>
<p><strong>READ: <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/dravidian-movement-family-tree-jayalalithaa-tamil-nadu-elections-karunanidihi-dmk-aiadmk-vaiko-2771834/">The Dravida Family Tree</a></strong></p>

<p>Others point out that Karunanidhi still remains popular among colleagues, and for the reason that in a state with imperious leaders, surrounded by powerful coteries, he is open. “If I call him now and ask for an appointment, he would ask me to come immediately. That is Karunanidhi,” says Anbumani Ramadoss, leader of the PMK, and incidentally now a bitter rival.</p>
<p>Before the Trichy rally, the DMK men thronging outside his room are all carrying photographs of party leader K N Nehru. Partymen point out that unlike the AIADMK, the DMK also allows its second-level leaders to bloom.</p>
<p>Closest friend and advisor M Naganathan, former head of economics at the University of Madras and ex-vice chairman of the state planning commission, says his memories of Karunanidhi revolve around their morning walks together for almost 25 years, until he became wheel-chair bound.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2778739" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/karuna4g1.jpg" alt="Karuna4G" width="759" height="736" /></p>
<p>Naganathan also vouches that unlike Jayalalithaa’s actions against him — including sending police to arrest him at midnight in June 2001 — Karunanidhi never expresses any kind of venom towards her. “She is too junior to him, he has seen her since she entered the film industry as a child. When Kalaignar’s police went to arrest Jayalalithaa in 1996 (for alleged corruption), she kept them waiting for one-and-a-half hours. Karunanidhi asked the officers to arrest her only when she came out.”</p>
<p>Dismissing talk that Karunanidhi step down, an old-timer who meets the DMK chief off and on, says Stalin too bows before his father still. “Unless there is a constitutional framework imposing an age limit for leaders, it would be foolish to judge a leader by his age. Is V S Achuthanandan at 92 incompetent? Was Jyoti Basu a failure at 96? R Venkataraman was in his late 80s when he became the president of India.”</p>
<p>Still, even the leader of a party formed with a rationalist agenda can do with some prayers now. Four hours before the Trichy rally is to begin, a brief prayer is held at the hotel Karunanidhi is staying in. Party leader A Raja, another 2G scam survivor, is among the dozen or so leaders gathered as a priest holds prayers for Karunanidhi&#8217;s health.<br />
Ask him about his contemporary Achuthanandan, and Karunanidhi is brief, “I wish him all the best for his success.”</p>
<p><em><strong>The scriptwriter</strong></em></p>
<p>* Muthuvel Karunanidhi was born on June 3, 1924, in Thirukkuvalai, a village near Thiruvarur. A school dropout, he was a screenwriter in the Tamil film industry before entering politics. The film circle in which he was active had political links with the Dravidian movement against Brahminism, and Karunanidhi was a founding member of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).</p>
<p>* Along with C N Annadurai, he organised local protests against “powerful north Indian men imposing Hindi names” in 1953.</p>
<p>* He won his first election from Kulithalai in Trichy district in 1957, winning a seat in the Assembly of Madras Presidency.</p>
<p>* After the DMK parted ways with Periyar’s Dravidar Kazhagam (DK), won the elections in 1967 and Annadurai became the CM, Karunanidhi became public works minister. After Annadurai’s death in early 1969, Karunanidhi succeeded him till 1971. He returned to the CM’s office in the election in 1971.</p>
<p>* The DMK faced a vertical split in 1972 after MGR decided to float AIADMK following a tussle with with Karunanidhi. In five years, MGR captured power from DMK and ruled the state till 1987.</p>
<p>* He returned to power in 1989.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778405&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[CJI T S Thakur’s emotional plea to the government to strengthen judicial infrastructure raises key questions: How vacant are our benches? Who is to blame and is there a way out?<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778419&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2778428 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/judge-759.jpg" alt="T s thakur, CJI thakur, thakur judges, t s thakur judges, india news, latest news, supreme court pending cases, india pending court cases, india judges shortage, thakur judges shortage, india news" /> Illustration: C R Sasikumar
<p>Last Sunday, addressing the conference of Chief Justices and Chief Ministers, Chief Justice of India (CJI) Tirath Singh Thakur became emotional as he spoke about the shortage of judges in the country, telling the audience, which included Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> and Union Law Minister D V Sadananda Gowda, that the judiciary shouldn’t alone have to bear the cross for the huge pendency of cases in the country. Referring to the shortage of judges — both in lower and higher judiciary — in the country, the CJI lamented the “inaction” on the government’s part in strengthening judicial infrastructure and increasing the judge-population ratio to deal with the mounting number of cases. While the CJI did manage to put the government on the backfoot, answers to the real issues remained elusive.</p>
<p>First, the facts. India has a total of 21,598 judges (sanctioned strength till December 31, 2015). This figure includes 20,502 judges in lower courts, 1,065 high court judges and 31 Supreme Court judges. However, on the day CJI Thakur made his impassioned speech (April 24), there were six vacancies in the Supreme Court, 432 in the various high courts and a whopping 4,432 (as of December 31, 2015) in the subordinate judiciary.</p>
<p>But, more importantly, if all the 20,502 posts of judges in the subordinate judiciary are somehow filled, there wouldn’t be enough courtrooms to accommodate all of them since there are currently only 16,513 courtrooms —a shortfall of 3,989 — across the country. Judicial infrastructure, it is clear, hasn’t kept pace with the rate of litigation.</p>
<p>In 1987, the Law Commission of India pointed out that the judge-population ratio in India was only 10.5 judges per million population (it is now 12 judges per million) while the ratio was 41.6 in Australia, 50.9 in England, 75.2 in Canada and 107 in the United States. The Commission recommended that India required 107 judges per million population. It also suggested that to begin with, the judge strength could be raised five-fold (to 50 judges per million population) in a period of five years. Almost 30 years later, even that five-fold-increase target looks distant.</p>
<p>The gravity of the situation is all the more pronounced when you consider the fact that there are 38.76 lakh cases pending as on December 31, 2015, in all high courts, of which 7.45 lakh — almost 20 per cent — have been pending for over 10 years.</p>
<p>The situation in subordinate courts is not any better. Of the 2.18 crore cases pending in lowers courts in the country, 1.46 lakh are criminal cases and over 72 lakh are civil cases.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while the Supreme Court saw a rise in the number of cases disposed of over three years — from 40,189 in 2013 to 47,424 in 2015 — the figures for disposal by high courts actually went down from 17.72 lakh to 16.05 lakh in that period.</p>
<p>Subordinate courts too have shown a fall in the disposal rate, with 1.87 crore cases being disposed of in 2013 and 1.78 crore being disposed of in 2015.</p>
<p>The Sunday Express speaks to serving and retired judges, legal experts, including eminent lawyers and policy planners, to find some answers to the vexed issues of pendency and shortage of judges and whether both the judiciary and the government have a plan to deal with these.</p>
<p><strong>Do we need more judges?</strong></p>
<p>“Of course. There is a burning need to increase the number of judges at all levels, including the Supreme Court and the subordinate courts,” says E M Sudarsana Natchiappan, MP and Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Law and Justice. “But, let’s first start with filling the existing vacancies. In most states, the high courts have taken upon themselves the job of selecting subordinate judges. But the results so far are not very heartening. There are either not enough good applicants&#8230; or the judges don’t have adequate time to do this job. Also, there is need for more transparency in appointment of high court judges. Everything should be in the public domain. Put up the names of the candidates on the website at every stage —from the preliminary level to the final stage of President’s approval, with recommendations at various stages. Secondly, civil court fees structure must be suitably modified and it must be made mandatory for state governments to spend the entire fees so collected on building judicial infrastructure,” he adds.<br />
Frivolous litigation as PILs?</p>
<p>Adding to the long list of pending cases are cases such as these: Taking suo motu cognisance, a judicial magistrate in a district court in Mahoba, Uttar Pradesh, in October 2015 registered a case accusing Finance Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/arun-jaitley/">Arun Jaitley</a> of <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/what-is-section-124-a-under-which-one-is-charged-with-sedition/">sedition</a> for allegedly criticising the Supreme Court on the issue of appointment of judges. The summons issued to Jaitley were later quashed by the Allahabad High Court. In August 2014, a court in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, directed the police to register a case against Bollywood actor <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/aamir-khan/">Aamir Khan</a>, filmmakers Raju Hirani, Vidhu Vinod Chopra and others for publication of a poster of their movie PK.</p>
<p>Attorney General of India Mukul Rohtagi says, “I think there is needless interference and no self-restraint by the judges. Too much time is being wasted on cases that are plain frivolous. Frivolous cases that consume too much court time should be dealt with a heavy hand and exemplary costs should be imposed on such litigation. The same must be done for cases where corporates file frivolous cases against their business rivals. The judiciary will have to devise a way to deal with this. Unless this is done, even a ten-fold increase in the strength of judges won’t serve any purpose.”</p>
<p>Former Supreme Court Judge H S Bedi agrees. “Frivolous litigation needs to be tightly regulated. I also agree that in some cases, judges overstep the boundary. They must remember that courts can’t be a substitute for the government.” He also added that while speedy disposal of cases should be a priority, cases must not be dismissed only because it amounts to addition in the number of disposed cases. “Cases must be decided on merit, not because speedy disposal needs to be done.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2778695" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/05/judges-graph.jpg" alt="judges-graph" width="759" height="858" /></p>
<p><strong>Long route to filling vacancies</strong></p>
<p>“It is not possible to fill all vacancies in one go. How can the Chief Justice and collegium of, let’s say, the Allahabad High Court, recommend names for all the 75-odd vacancies that exist right now? For this, they will have to really lower the standard and opt for sixth- or even seventh-tier lawyers. Also, how can the government expect Chief Justices (of high courts) to recommend names when earlier names recommended by them are still under process? But I strongly feel that the existing system of bringing 30 per cent (HC) judges from the subordinate judiciary is flawed since the person who comes at the fag end of his or her career becomes a high court judge only due to seniority. Such a person will only spend their time waiting for eventual retirement. I think either this quota needs to be revised or such elevations must only be on the basis of performance as a judge,” notes Justice Bedi.</p>
<p><strong>Paucity of good candidates?</strong></p>
<p>“Over the years, I have seen a general reluctance among good lawyers to accept judgeship. But I refuse to accept that money is the only criteria behind this. Anybody who accepts it has to do it for the honour, prestige and dignity attached to it. It may be the case that now many good lawyers don’t feel there is enough dignity in being a judge. But this must change,” says former Union law minister and senior lawyer Ashwani Kumar.</p>
<p><strong>Government as biggest litigant</strong></p>
<p>P K Malhotra, who retired as Union law secretary last week, says, “That the government is the biggest litigant is a fact and we are aware of that. But very few people realise that in most cases the government is either the respondent or a proforma party (where the main case is against somebody else). The National Litigation Policy that the government is finalising will deal with this issue, especially the needless and vexatious litigation by government departments. The Legal Information Management-Based System (LIMBS), which we have launched, makes it mandatory for all government ministries to upload all data about pending cases involving them so that we can monitor them.”</p>
<p><strong>Is there a way ahead ?</strong></p>
<p>As a former Supreme Court judge who was a member of the collegium says, there is no “quick-fix solution” to the issue of shortage of judges and pendency.</p>
<p>“It is only in the last 15 years or so that we have started talking about the judicial system and the issues connected to it. Look at the money that the governments were earlier allocating to the judicial sector for creation of infrastructure and hiring more judges. It was dismal, and I am being charitable. However, now both the Supreme Court and Central and state governments are aware of the situation and are working together to find solutions. Funds, while still not adequate, are more freely available and are being spent. In most states, there is a visible change in the infrastructure,” says the judge, who didn’t wish to be quoted.</p>
<p>As per government figures, from Rs 1,245 crore spent on creating judicial infrastructure under the centrally sponsored schemes between 1993 and 2011, the amount went up to Rs 3,695 crore from 2012 to 2016.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2606783" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/kgbalakrishnan-759.jpg" alt="Justice K G Balakrishnan" width="759" height="422" /></p>
<p><span style="color:red;"><strong>Interview with K G Balakrishnan</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>‘Don’t think retired judges will work as additional judges. Why not appoint regular judges?&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>As Chief Justice of India, K G Balakrishnan tried to bring in lawyers to become additional sessions judges for five-year terms and appoint eminent lawyers as ad hoc judges. In an interview with Maneesh Chhibber, the former CJI and ex-NHRC chief says he didn’t see “much enthusiasm” for the scheme.</p>
<p><strong>You tried to get lawyers to work as additional sessions judges. What was the response?</strong></p>
<p>Initially, we tried to appoint lawyers for this post for a fixed period. Some of them were later absorbed in the service. But later, some state governments were not very keen to provide funds to pay their salaries, etc.</p>
<p><strong>You also tried to get regular subordinate court judges to hold sittings beyond normal working hours. Did that work?</strong></p>
<p>We asked judges to sit for two hours (6 pm to 8 pm) after finishing their regular court work. For this, they as well as their court staff were given extra money. In some areas like Bengaluru and Ahmedabad, this worked very well. However, later, many state governments didn’t provide funds for this. So, it fell through. Such a system works wonders in a place where a magistrate has a large number of cases. But for this, the magistrate, his staff, his peon, everyone needs incentives.</p>
<p><strong>There is a suggestion that retired judges could be asked to work as ad hoc or additional judges in the Supreme Court or high courts. Will that help tackle the issue of pendency?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t think many retired judges will be willing to work as additional judges after they have demitted office. Some of them may be holding post-retirement jobs, some may be doing arbitration. Why not appoint more regular judges?</p>
<p><strong>Whose responsibility is it to ensure that all vacancies are filled — the government’s or the collegium’s?</strong></p>
<p>We can’t pin responsibility on any one person or agency. There should be timely recommendations by the collegium, the government must clear the cases quickly and warrants should be issued. As for subordinate judiciary, it is the duty of the chief justice of the respective high court to take the initiative to see that selections are made on time. There is a system already in place, that every year, vacancies that are likely to arise should be calculated and the process for filling those vacancies should begin. Unfortunately, not all high courts follow this.</p>
<p><strong>Does the judiciary have too many vacations?</strong></p>
<p>It was earlier eight weeks and we cut it by one week. Then we tried to cut one more week for the Supreme Court, but there was no unanimity among the judges. Some judges raised objections and said, ‘do it after our retirement’. So I dropped the proposal. But a majority of judges were willing to reduce it to six weeks. It’s not just the judiciary; in this country, we have too many holidays.</p>

He is in-charge of the centre. (Source: Express photo Vasant Prabhu)
<p>When a fire gutted rare specimens at the National Museum of Natural History in Delhi on April 26, Dr Santosh Gaikwad’s heart sank. The country’s lone practising taxidermist now, Gaikwad remembers drawing inspiration from a treasure trove of stuffed animals, mounted during British rule, showcased at the museum. “Perhaps the largest wildlife collection of taxidermy in India,” he rues.</p>
<p>The fire also brought back a familiar fear: that the art of taxidermy might die with him.</p>
<p>As part of taxidermy, a dead animal’s skeleton and skin are carefully extracted. The skeleton is then repositioned with an iron support, stuffed with clay or some other mould, and the original skin wrapped around it to create a life-size specimen. This generally stays intact for a hundred years.</p>
<p>Taxidermy was popular over a century ago when royals hunted animals and showcased them as trophies. With the introduction of the Wildlife Protection Act and the ban on hunting, taxidermy has been reduced to an art confined to a few museums.</p>
<p>Gaikwad was first drawn towards it in 2003 when, as a 29-year-old, he visited the Prince of Wales Museum in Mumbai. He was an assistant professor of anatomy and a practising veterinarian at the time.</p>
<p>He initially tried to join a course on taxidermy, but when he found none, he began visiting the museum, lying on the floor to observe the cuts and stitches underneath the model. With those observations and the help of a few retired experts, he taught himself the art. To hone his skill, Gaikwad learnt carpentry, worked at Ganpati workshops to pick up moulding and casting techniques, and spent time with students of the J J School of Art to learn painting.</p>
<p>In 2005, he finally took the plunge and chucked his vet job. Now, a huge deep freezer in the Department of Anatomy at the Bombay Veterinary College, where he teaches anatomy to students, holds a dead calf, a dog, and two rare fish, all waiting to be taxidermied by Gaikwad. At his old home in Jogeshwari, where his family stayed till last year, three more dead pet birds lie in a tiny refrigerator. “My wife does not like dead animals in the house now, even those taxidermied,” he laughs. His family has moved to a one-bedroom flat in Andheri, a much crowded western suburb of Mumbai.</p>
<p>Among his other assignments is the stuffing of a leopard, Raja, which died over three months ago at the Sanjay Gandhi National Park. The park has the country’s only taxidermy centre, and in 2009, the Maharashtra forest department made him in-charge of it.</p>
<p>The Taraporewala Aquarium has sought him out to make a few fish specimens, as has his old haunt, the Prince of Wales Museum, which wants its old specimens replaced. Gaikwad charges between Rs 10,000 and Rs 20,000 for birds — the price depends on size and difficulty — and over Rs 50,000 for large animals like lions and tigers.</p>
<p>The taxidermist’s day begins with dropping his children to school at 6:45 am. He then goes on a half-hour run before reaching the Bombay Veterinary College in Goregaon, to teach anatomy to first and second-year students until noon.</p>
<p>The college has given him a separate room to stuff and preserve animals in his free time. A rack in his department is stacked with bones of various animals. A room, full of glass-encased displays, has preserved animal organs. But the centrepiece for him is the last glass case in a corridor — it contains a taxidermied hen and a duck. “Stroke the feathers, they are still soft. This is a decade old,” he smiles.</p>
<p>On Thursday, as a group of 15 huddle around him in class, he displays a calf’s head. “Samajh aa raha hai na (Can you all understand)?” he asks. During the lecture, he keeps telling the students to join him at the national park and learn about taxidermy. “You won’t find a teacher after me,” he tells them. The students do turn up at the park, but only to click pictures with the specimen of a dead lion, Ranga, before leaving. Nobody waits to see Gaikwad at work.</p>
<p>It is lunch hour and Gaikwad has to go to the veterinary college’s Parel campus, some 20 km away, to teach another batch of students. Again, he is more keen on talking about taxidermy to his class.</p>
<p>Gaikwad says he has so far created life-size specimens of 12 big cats, a black bear, its cub, an elephant’s head, a mule, a 6.3-foot- long turtle, over 100 fish and 500 birds.</p>
<p>He remembers 25 failed attempts with dead birds while he was learning. He would collect the birds from the college campus, shove them in a bag, and put them in the refrigerator at home. “Yes, my wife was cooperative then,” he says. She shared her fridge as he had no other freezer at the time.</p>
<p>Gaikwad credits his wife’s early acceptance of his profession with having made the difference. His father, who was a sub-inspector with the Mumbai Police, also objected initially, particularly to the hours he spent working on specimens. “When I start skinning, it can go on for hours and I forget attending family events,” Gaikwad admits.</p>
<p>Gaikwad’s day at college usually ends at 5.30 pm, after which he heads home. “Over the years, my dining table has been used more for animals than food,” he jokes.</p>
<p>His children, Samruddhi (13) and Sarthak (8), are used to watching their father “do something with frozen animals”. Samruddhi also plays with the bird specimens he makes.</p>
<p>For over three hours every evening, Gaikwad again works on his projects. He has dinner with family, and finally wraps up around midnight.</p>
<p>He talks about the time in 2009 when he had got a call from Nainital, soon after the death of the country’s last Siberian tiger. The authorities had wanted it preserved, so that it could be showcased at the High Altitude Zoo there.</p>
<p>Gaikwad says he had dropped everything, taken the first available flight to Delhi, and rushed to Nainital. “The skin of an animal must be removed within 36 hours of death,” he says. He had later fleshed out all the organs, and extracted the bones to carry with him. “I forgot I could be stopped at the Delhi airport,” he laughs.</p>
<p>The security check scan showed teeth and bones in his long black bag. With airport authorities clueless about taxidermy, Gaikwad had ended up missing his flight.</p>
<p>That tiger specimen, which had taken over five months to be prepared, is now on display in Nainital.</p>
<p>Every day, he says, is another opportunity to try and attain similar perfection. “Jab lage ki asli lion hai, tab model perfect hota hai (When it looks like a real lion, then the model is perfect).”</p>
<p>Recently, Gaikwad taught 15 forest officials to prepare a specimen of a bird. They never turned up with their models but he hasn’t given up on them.</p>
<p>His eyes sparkling, he says, “You know what would be really challenging?</p>
<p>A human taxidermy&#8230; If a VIP wants himself preserved.”</p>
<p><strong>A science and an art</strong></p>
<p>Taxidermy is a combination of art and science in which a dead animal can be preserved by using its skin on another mould. This field combines knowledge of anatomy, carpentry, painting and moulding. The skeleton of the dead animal is reused as main cast. In India, apart from Gaikwad, there are estimated to be four other taxidermists. They are not known to practise anymore.</p>

<p>The phenomenon popularly known as the 22 degree circular halo of the sun or occasionally the Moon (also called a moon ring or winter halo), occurs when the sun&#8217;s or moon&#8217;s rays get deflected/ refracted through the hexagonal ice crystals present in cirrus clouds, a senior researcher with the MP Birla Planetarium told.</p>
<p>&#8220;These kind of cirrus clouds are generally formed when water vapour freezes into ice crystals at altitudes five to ten kilometres above the earth&#8217;s surface,&#8221; the researcher said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very common phenomenon in the cold countries. But in our countries it&#8217;s occurrence is rare and cannot be predicted&#8230; The red and blue ring around the sun was seen for around 30 minutes,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The 22 degree halo was last observed in April 2013 in the suburbs of the city, the meteorologist said, adding, the phenomenon takes place before an impending storm.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778340&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Source: ANI)
<p>With major fires blighting around 1,900 hectares of forests in Uttarakhand, the government today decided to press two MI-17 helicopters into service as NDRF, SDRF and Army personnel struggled to douse the flames which have claimed six lives till now.</p>
<p>A total of 1890.79 hectares of green cover have been destroyed this fire season which had an early start on February 2 due to a dry winter. Chamoli, Pauri, Rudraprayag, Tehri, Uttarkashi, Almora, Pithoragarh and Nainital are the worst-affected districts. While three NDRF teams and one SDRF company are busy dousing the flames in different parts of the state, two IAF choppers have been sent to Nainital and Pauri districts, among the worst hit, to spray water over the burning jungles, Raj Bhawan officials here said.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2755412 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/odd-even1.jpg" alt="odd even1" /> The Deputy Mayor said that it was matter of concern that people are using less LPG and shifting to electric appliances due to higher cost of cooking gas but it was resulting in emission of green house gases.
<p>The Himachal Pradesh capital is a &#8220;fit case&#8221; for car-rationing odd-even scheme on the pattern of Delhi because emission of carbon dioxide and other green house gasses accounted for 35.91 per cent of total emission, Deputy Mayor of Shimla Municipal Corporation Tikender Singh Panwar Saturday said.</p>
<p>An European Commission-sponsored study conducted for evaluating green house gas eEmissions in Shimla town has come handy to Shimla Municipal Corporation(SMC) authorities to bat for introducing the odd-even system for plying vehicles within municipal limits. The study report was released by Panwar.</p>
<p>Panwar said that SMC would write to National Green Tribunal (NGT) about it as odd-even system, coupled with use of battery-operated and CNG vehicles and tax on diesel vehicles entering the city could go a long way in reducing the carbon emissions besides decongesting the town.</p>

<p>He said that as per the green house gas emissions inventory prepared for Shimla under urban LEDs project funded by European Union commission and United Nations Habitat, Shimla city has a total energy consumption of 16,07,996 Giga Joules and the total GHG emission is 218,898 tonnes of carbon dioxide out of which electricity amounts to 59 per cent, petrol 12 per cent and diesel 28 per cent.</p>
<p>“The inventory would help in developing a comprehensive methodological framework to integrate low carbon strategies into all sectors of urban planning and development in order to make the city more livable with a major focus on reducing the GHG emission from stationary fuel combustion in residential sector which is 1,81,473 tonnes of carbon dioxide”, Panwar said adding emissions from commercial sector is 5,876 tonnes of CO2 which is quite less as compared to residential sector.</p>
<p>Stressing that there is a need to switchover completely to renewable energy like use of solar panel for water heating, cooking and lighting in the commercial and residential sectors, he said what is needed is Analyse, Act and Accelerate for climate change mitigation.</p>

<p>The Deputy Mayor said that it was matter of concern that people are using less LPG and shifting to electric appliances due to higher cost of cooking gas but it was resulting in emission of green house gases.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778301&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The accident took place when the BJP MP was going to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Veterinary University and Gau Anusandhan Kendra to inaugurate a function.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the vehicles in the MP&#8217;s cavalcade suddenly applied the brakes, halting the movement of the other vehicles. Meanwhile, a speeding car entered into the fleet and brushed past the vehicle carrying the MP,&#8221; Sanjai Govil, BJP leader, said.</p>
<p>The stray vehicle fled the spot thereafter, he added.</p>
<p>The Bollywood actor had met with an accident in Rajasthan last year, in which a four-year-old girl was killed and five others were injured, including Hema Malini.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778294&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Source: PTI)
<p>Congress on Saturday took a dig at Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> over the issue of his educational qualification saying his government was a &#8220;habitual offender&#8221; on the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Prime Minister himself is seeking to hide his educational qualifications, then how could common man have the confidence to use the RTI as a tool to fight corruption,&#8221; party&#8217;s chief spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala said when asked about the CIC&#8217;s direction to universities in Delhi and Gujarat to provide proper responses to RTI applications seeking details of education qualification of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Recalling the degree row in which HRD Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/smriti-irani/">Smriti Irani</a> was involved, he noted that a court case is also on in the matter. He said there is also controversy over the degree of Minister of State of HRD Ram Shankar Katheria.</p>

<p>Insisting that the Congress respected the Prime Minister despite being his opponent, Surjewala, however, said if the Prime Minister &#8220;himself hides his degrees, then how could be the Right to Information be defended&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said that not only should the Prime Minister make public his educational qualifications, but he should also &#8220;act against those in the PMO who attempted to malign him by not giving the information&#8221;.</p>
<p>He alleged that other <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> leaders too have &#8220;misled&#8221; on their educational qualifications and that they were &#8220;habitual offenders&#8221;.</p>

<p>Surjewala&#8217;s remarks came close on the heels of the Central Information Commission giving direction to the universities of Delhi and Gujarat to provide proper responses to RTI applications seeking details of education qualification of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The CIC&#8217;s order came a day after Delhi Chief Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/arvind-kejriwal/">Arvind Kejriwal</a> wrote a letter to CIC saying he does not object to government records about him being made public and wondered why the Commission wants to &#8220;hide&#8221; information on Modi&#8217;s educational qualification.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778287&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gujarat Pradesh <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> Committee (GPCC) on Saturday held demonstrations and burnt effigies of prime minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> outside all the 33 district collectorates and eight mahanagarpalikas , demanding a Supreme Court monitored probe into what it calls Rs 20,000 crore scam in Krishna-Godavari basin involving Modi when he was chief minister of the state.</p>
<p>Stating that the scam was bigger than the 2G scam, state party spokesperson Manish Doshi said that the Modi regime in the state had given Gujarat state petroleum corporation&#8217;s (GSPC) 10 per cent stake amounting to Rs 20,000 crore in KG basin gas field to GeoGlobal Resources, a multinational company existing on paper, for nothing.</p>

<p>Kanhaiya along with Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya were arrested in connection with an event on campus against hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru during which anti-national slogans were allegedly raised. They are now out on bail.</p>
<p>On basis of the recommendations of a university probe panel, JNU had earlier this week announced punishments against several students in connection with the event.</p>
<p>While Kanhaiya has been slapped with a penalty of Rs 10,000 on grounds of &#8220;indiscipline and misconduct&#8221;, Umar, Anirban and Kashmiri student Mujeeb Gatoo have been rusticated for varying durations.</p>
<p>Financial penalty has been imposed on 14 students. Hostel facilities of two students have been withdrawn and the university has declared the campus out of bounds for two former students.</p>
<p>ABVP member Saurabh Sharma, who was complainant of the event, has also been slapped with a fine of Rs 10,000 for blocking traffic.</p>

<p>The party also asked the government to come clean on allegations that former Air Chief S P Tyagi had links with Vivekananda Foundation, a Delhi based think tank, once headed by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. It also wondered whether this was the reason behind the probe agencies going &#8220;slow&#8221; in the investigation.</p>

<p>&#8220;This deal started during Atal Bihari Vajpayee&#8217;s tenure. It was completed by the Manmohan Singh government and (it) cancelled the deal. It appears that since Congress and the BJP have both blackened their hands, this is why the Modi government is not taking any action against <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/">Sonia Gandhi</a>,&#8221; AAP leader Sanjay Singh said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the intentions of Modi government is to combat corruption, then it should arrest those involved in it, right from Sonia Gandhi, Ahmed Patel to S P Tyagi and many other officers and politicians&#8230;whose name in involved in the AgustaWestland chopper deal. Even some journalists are believed to have been involved,&#8221; he said.</p>

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEYBjqe0fs4&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
<p>The party also posed six questions to the government over the investigations in the deal.</p>
<p>&#8220;What progress has the government done in the AgustaWestland chopper deal case and what is its outcome? If the government of Italy can send the culprits to jail then why was the government sleeping over it for the last two years.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the name of Sonia Gandhi and Ahmed Patel cropped up in the Appellate court in Italy the Modi government was pretending to remain active. Had the government been actually active in the last two years, then their name would have come in the probe done by the ED and the CBI. And why did it have to wait for Appellate Court&#8217;s order,&#8221; AAP leader Ashutosh said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is evident that S P Tyagi has taken bribe. What is the connection of S P Tyagi with Vivekananda Foundation. NSA Ajit Doval and Prime Minister&#8217;s Principal Secretary Nripendra Misra, both believed to be very powerful bureaucrats linked to Vivekananda Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;So what is the link of the two with S P Tyagi. Why is he still not being sent to jail. Why should not this be believed that there is friendship between Ajit Doval and S P Tyagi and this is why the probe is not getting over,&#8221; Ashutosh added.</p>
<p>Strongly refuting the allegations, the government termed attempts to link Doval and Misra to one of the accused as &#8220;totally baseless assertion and indicative of malicious intent&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ashutosh also questioned the government for not interrogating Gandhi in the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Its been days that the Appellate Court came up with its judgement. Leave alone arrest. Why has the BJP not started the process of even interrogating Sonia Gandhi and other leaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amit Shah has asked Sonia Gandhi to name bribe-takers. Have they admitted the fact that CBI and ED are unable to find the truth which is why they are asking the Congress to reveal the names of the bribe-takers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Congress party has challenged to investigate the matter in two months. If the culprits are challenging the government, then does the government accept the challenge and complete the probe and send them to jail by July 30, 2016,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Likening the AgustaWestland Chopper deal with Bofors scam, Sanjay Singh said if action is not taken on this immediately then the matter will be put in cold storage.</p>

<p>In the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) yesterday, first after its reconstitution, the party has decided to intensify the attack on the Congress and BJP over the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;On March 7, we will gherao the residences of Prime Minister and Congress President Sonia Gandhi. We appeal to our volunteers from across the country to come to Delhi on this day to participate in the protest,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778132&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>As <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> projects itself as an alternative in the bi-polar polity of Kerala, former union minister A K Antony Saturday said its goal was to ensure defeat of the ruling-UDF led by <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> in the May 16 assembly polls to weaken the party at the national level.</p>
<p>The UDF should ensure that BJP did not get a single seat in the elections so that communal harmony was preserved in the state, the senior Congress leader told a meet-the press organised by Kerala Union of Working Journalists.</p>

<p>Antony, who is launching his whirlwind campaign tour from Kasargod on Sunday, also came down on CPI-M&#8217;s &#8216;politics of violence&#8217; and said LDF should not come to power as the Marxist party was 25 years behind in matters of development.</p>
<p>Taking a dig at the CPI(M), he said the Communist party, which was very active in the social media now had tooth and nail opposed the introduction of computers by Rajiv Gandhi and mechanisation of farm operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;CPI(M) was like a &#8216;rip wan winkle&#8217; and wakes up only after a gap of 25 years. So, we should not allow it to come to power,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Targeting the BJP, Antony said after the NDA came to power two years ago, there had been several instances of tension and violence from various parts of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Communal polarisation, creating communal divide and tensions&#8221; were the main agenda of the BJP, he alleged.</p>
<p>Since coming to power, the slogan of BJP-NDA was &#8216;Congress free India&#8217;, he said cautioning that if Congress was weakened, &#8220;there will be none to challenge them&#8221;, he said.</p>
<p>Congress President <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/">Sonia Gandhi</a> and Vice President <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/rahul-gandhi/">Rahul Gandhi</a> had been battling both inside and outside Parliament against the &#8216;wrong&#8217; policies of the NDA government, he said.</p>
<p>As part of BJP&#8217;s &#8216;conspiracy&#8217; to weaken the Congress, governments in Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand were brought down, and in BJP ruled states of Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat, where Congress was the main opposition, attempts were being made to make it less effective, he alleged.</p>
<p>Antony also said the alliance forged by BJP with Bharat Dharma Jana Sena of Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam in Kerala would not yield desired result to both parties.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kerala voters will not accept this alliance and I feel that both parties will suffer,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>BJP, which is yet to send a member to the Kerala assembly, is going all out to break the jinx this time and has lined up campaign rallies by top leaders led by Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a>, who will address six meetings, and party chief Amit Shah.</p>
<p>On UDF&#8217;s prospects, Antony said he felt both UDF and LDF were neck-and-neck in the race now, while a couple of a days ago LDF did have an edge.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>
[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
<p>He wanted Congress and UDF workers to sink differences if any and work for the victory of the front.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a do or die battle. UDF&#8217;s victory is the aim. We should set aside small differences and fight unitedly to ensure that UDF emerges victorious,&#8221; Antony said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778114&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The CBI has initiated its preliminary investigations into the sting operation in which Rawat was purportedly seen talking to middlemen in a bid to strike a deal with rebel Congress MLAs.</p>
<p>The agency questioned the journalist allegedly involved in the sting operation at its headquarters in New Delhi yesterday as part of its preliminary enquiry.</p>
<p>Alleging that the reputation of the journalist who made the CD has always been under suspicion, Rawat said a close analysis of the content of the CD in totality puts it beyond doubt that there was a &#8220;criminal conspiracy jointly hatched by BJP and Congress backstabbers&#8221; to topple an elected government in Uttarakhand.</p>
<p>Reading out transcripts of the CD as it appeared on social media at a press conference here, Rawat said names of Vijay Bahuguna, Saket Bahuguna and Kailash Vijayvargiya had been mentioned in the CD as people involved in the plot to throw him out of power.</p>
<p>Questioning the antecedents of the journalist who had made the CD, Rawat alleged dozens of cases had been lodged against him during the tenure of a former BJP chief minister on the basis of which a red corner notice had also been issued against him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t the BJP show the courage of instituting a probe against the man who made the CD. His reputation has always been under a cloud of suspicion,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Claiming that he was innocent, he said the CD was made to &#8220;malign him &#8211; a fact corroborated by its timing exactly six months before the state was to go to polls.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, he said he was ready for any probe and will cooperate with any impartial inquiry into the sting CD.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778089&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcoming the Bombay High Court&#8217;s order in the Adarsh Society scam, Mumbai <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> chief Ashish Shelar Saturday demanded that Maharashtra government should lodge an FIR in the case.</p>
<p>Some people had benefited in the scam and hence we want registration of an FIR first and not just re-inquiry, he said.</p>

<p>The Bombay High Court had Friday ordered demolition of the 31-storey scam-tainted Adarsh apartments in the heart of Mumbai and sought criminal proceedings against politicians and bureaucrats for &#8220;misuse&#8221; of powers, holding that the tower was illegally constructed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ramifications of the case which involves cheating are wide. The role of politicians who helped their relatives obtain flats in the controversial Adarsh society needs to be probed,&#8221; Shelar told reporters here.</p>
<p>During the previous <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a>-NCP regime, the then Governor denied permission to the CBI to prosecute the Chief<br />
Minister (Ashok Chavan) in the case, he said.</p>
<p>After the BJP-led state government took over in 2014, the present Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao granted CBI the permission to prosecute the guilty, Shelar said.</p>
<p>The role of the officials of Mumbai civic body (MCGM) and those in the state government should also to be investigated, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;An inquiry will reveal everything but we demand that the government first file an FIR,&#8221; Shelar added.</p>
<p>The posh 31-storey Adarsh Housing Society is constructed on a prime plot of land in Colaba here. It was meant for Kargil war widows and defence personnels.</p>

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
<p>However, politicians, bureaucrats and military officers allegedly conspired to bend rules and obtained flats for themselves or for relatives at below-the-market rates.</p>
<p>The scam that came to light in November 2010 had forced the then Chief Minister Ashok Chavan to resign.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2778028&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a sharp attack on <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> and CPI-M in Kerala, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Saturday said the state had been let down by the two parties which relied on politics of &#8216;vote banks&#8217;.</p>
<p>Speaking after releasing the NDA vision document for the May 16 assembly elections in the state, he also said the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> has emerged as an alternative to the two parties, which have been ruling the state alternately.</p>

<p>&#8220;BJP has become an alternative in Kerala and its vote strength was reflected in the last Parliament and civic body elections,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jaitely claimed the domination of Congress and CPI-M in the state was not based on any developmental politics, but on an emphasis to keep certain vote banks with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you have vote banks based on sectarian appeal, you do not have to relay much on performance,&#8221; Jaitely said.</p>
<p>Stating that Kerala should have been one of the most prosperous states in the country going by the assets it has, Jaitely said the economic model created by the Left was not a developmental model.</p>
<p>Congress-led UDF also followed the same line and their domination in politics was with emphasis to keep certain vote banks with them, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kerala and West Bengal were the only two major states to face revenue deficit though not geographically disadvantaged,&#8221; the finance minister said, adding the common factor in these two states was the rule by the Left front which did not have an economic model.</p>
<p>Kerala and West Bengal were behind due to the Left rule and the ideology which they follow had been abandoned in many parts of the world, he said.</p>
<p>Jaitely said Kerala should make use of the manpower resources in the state itself rather than exporting it. The state should concentrate on development projects in areas like coastline based projects, tourism and plantation.</p>
<p>The NDA Vision Document promises among others land for landless, an housing programme in the name of &#8216;Sree Narayana<br />
Guru&#8217;, government jobs to all tribal youths who had passed tenth standard.</p>

<p>It also promises interest free agriculture loan to farmers, a package of Rs 10,000 crore to coastal belt, initiative to set up one lakh small industries and another Rs 10,000 crore package for traditional industries.</p>
<p>Union Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy, State BJP State President Kummanam Rajasekharan, Bharat Dharma Jana Sena President Thushar Vellapally, the second largest partner in the BJP-led NDA, were among those present on the occasion.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777969&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Singh deplored the way the &#8220;nationalist students were maltreated for upholding the honour of the Tricolor and confronting the anti-national elements&#8221;.</p>
<p>They said the rally would oppose and expose &#8220;deceitful and sacrilegious character&#8221; of the BJP and mobilize public opinion in support of &#8220;nationalist&#8221; students of NIT.</p>
<p>He said the NIT incident in which students were &#8220;abused, baton-charged and manhandled&#8221; for raising pro-India slogans and waving Tricolour to counter those rejoicing India&#8217;s defeat in the World T20 match was &#8220;excruciatingly distressful&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said the &#8220;obnoxious&#8221; situation which led to the &#8220;exodus of nationalist students&#8221; from the Valley further aggravated when the enquiry officer appointed by the state government reportedly indicted these students for allegedly vitiating the academic atmosphere in his probe report.</p>
<p>Singh also questioned the &#8220;silence&#8221; of Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> and the Union HRD Minister over the students&#8217; demand to have either of them to hoist the National Flag on the campus to send the message that Kashmir is an integral part of India.</p>
<p>He further criticised BJP ministers for their acquiescence to cricket tournaments in Kashmir to &#8220;glorify terrorists&#8221; as reported in a section of media on Saturday.</p>

<p>Lambasting the BJP&#8217;s slogan of &#8216;Zero Tolerance&#8217; and &#8220;incongruous&#8221; stand on nationalism, Balwant Singh Mankotia and Yashpal Kundal accused it of &#8220;chauvinistic posturing&#8221; during the JNU row by detaining student leaders and said &#8220;its persistent chest-thumping against anti-national elements fell flat on Kashmir turf&#8221;.</p>
<p>The JKNPP leaders sought the invocation of <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/what-is-section-124-a-under-which-one-is-charged-with-sedition/">sedition</a> charges against &#8220;offenders waging war against the country&#8221; and cautioned the state government against the &#8220;harassment&#8221; of &#8220;nationalist&#8221; NIT students.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777939&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The youths of <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/kashmir/">Kashmir</a> want to forget the past and move ahead in search of peace and better life, a peace activist, who claims to have walked from Kanyakumari to the Valley, said Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Kashmiri youths who we met during our short stay here want to forget the past. They want bygones to be bygones and move ahead in search of peace and better life,&#8221; Mumtaz Ali told reporters after the conclusion of his 474-day &#8216;Walk of Hope&#8217; which started from Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>The 67-year-old said &#8220;average Kashmiri&#8221; people were good, but needed help, love, and affection to move forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our message is peace and unity of humanity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The peace activist, who claims to have met over 10 lakh people during his 7500-km march through 11 states, said he would like to visit Kashmir again and meet the youths from interiors of the city which often witnesses violent protests.</p>
<p>&#8220;Violence is not a solution to any problem. All issues can be resolved peacefully by understanding each other,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ali said the antidote to Kashmir&#8217;s problems lies with its people, adding no one can bring solutions from outside.</p>
<p>Contrary to warnings about the situation in the state, Ali said he and his group have been welcomed by people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;This walk is not the end of the mission. There will be follow up to it to find out where we can help,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The first edition of the Walk of Hope covered states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The walk we completed did not include eastern and northeastern parts of our nation. The next edition is envisaged to start from Kanyakumari and proceed along those areas,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Ali said his mission was apolitical and he has not taken any funding from the corporate houses.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the small contributions by people that has made this mission possible,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777957&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Election Commission officials said after hearing her comments on TV they have asked the district authorities to file an FIR against her in this case.</p>
<p>In one of the booths in her constituency, voting was halted for sometime after an EVM was found to be malfunctioning.</p>

<p>Hearing this, Guha went to the booth and tried to check the EVM herself but was stopped by the central armed forces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Polling has stopped here for more than an hour but the EC has taken no action,&#8221; the Trinamool leader said.</p>
<p>The fifth phase of the state Assembly polls began on Saturday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777849&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The STF and ATS are also on the lookout for Muneer and he would be nabbed soon, Baghel said.</p>
<p>Ahmad, probing terror cases related to Indian Mujahideen, was shot dead by two unidentified motorcycle-borne assailants who also wounded his wife when they were returning home from a wedding near UP&#8217;s Bijnor town.</p>
<p>The officer&#8217;s wife succumbed to bullet injuries at AIIMS hospital on April 13.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court on Saturday extended the stay on registration of diesel vehicles above 2000 cc capacity in the Delhi-NCR region until further orders. The court was hearing various petitions related to its earlier rulings on controlling the problem of pollution in the city.</p>
<p>The court also slammed the government for not being serious about the issue of pollution, ANI reported.</p>
<p>Additionally, the court refused to extend the deadline for the conversion of private diesel taxis into CNG. Only CNG taxis will be allowed to ply on Delhi roads from May 1. Cabs with all-India permits are exempt from the order though.</p>

<p>A number of cab operators and their associations urged the court for an extension of the deadline, but a bench comprising Chief Justice T.S. Thakur, Justice A.K. Sikri and Justice R. Banumati refused the request.</p>
<p>The apex court had initially asked the diesel cab operators in the NCR to switch over to CNG by March 1. That deadline was later extended to March 31 and then to April 30.</p>

<p>Guha, who is contesting from Satgachia constituency in the ongoing West Bengal assembly polls, made the controversial comment in relation to an electronic voting machine (EVM) that she complained had been malfunctioning.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EVM here has been malfunctioning; it has been more than an hour that polling has been stopped because of that, but the EC (Election Commission) has taken no action,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Guha and her party colleagues protested against the alleged inaction of the Election Commission by a sit-in.</p>
<p>A little later, while talking over her mobile phone, Guha was shown by TV news channels as saying: &#8220;Mere baar kore dis CPM agentder ekdom, ora EVM kharap kore rekhe dia che. (Beat and drive out the CPI-M agent from the booth, they have done something to the EVM).</p>

<p>The CPI-M and Congress condemned the remarks and demanded Guha be arrested immediately.</p>
<p>Guha is the deputy speaker of the outgoing West Bengal Assembly.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777818&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2382395 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/05/igi_airport_delhi_759.jpg" alt="kashmir, Jammu and kashmir, indigo, religious discrimination flight, indigo flight religious discrimination, kashmir man flight religious discrimination, muslim man flight descrimination, kashmir news, india news, latest news" /> The airline in an emailed statement said the passengers were not accepted for the flight due to their late arrival.
<p>A <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/kashmir/">Kashmir</a>-based businessman travelling from New Delhi to Srinagar alleged that he and his aged mother were prevented from boarding a plane last week at the Delhi airport and has accused a private airline of discriminating on the basis of his religion.</p>
<p>A resident of Baramulla district, Khurshid Ahmad and his 85-year-old mother Taja Begum were scheduled to board an Indigo plane, 6E 555 on April 20 but were allegedly barred from travelling in the flight. &#8220;I had arrived well before time and even my luggage had passed through. There was some time for the flight departure. I went down and by the time I came back they had closed the gates,&#8221; he said, adding, &#8220;there was no announcement and when I asked the reason, I was told they no longer make announcements.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Ahmad said the next day when he returned to Delhi airport, he witnessed that announcements were made as usual. &#8220;This is sheer discrimination and intolerance against me and my mother. I even told them my mother is aged and cannot walk properly, but still I was forced to book a new flight,&#8221; he said. Ahmad said that he is moving the consumer court against the airline.</p>
<p>The airline in an emailed statement said the passengers were not accepted for the flight due to their late arrival. &#8220;The gate closure time mentioned on the boarding pass was 25 minutes prior to scheduled departure. The reporting time for boarding was 1235 hrs. As per the CCTV footage, both passengers had reached the gate 7B at 1255 hrs &#8211; when the boarding was closed for this flight,&#8221; Indigo said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Delhi airport is a silent airport. Hence, there are no announcements made before flight departures. To educate passengers against all flight departures/timings, signages and TV screens are placed across the airport,&#8221; the statement added.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court on Saturday allowed Delhi Police to purchase 197 heavy-duty vehicles to be used for various activities, including VVIP security, but asked it to pay a 30 percent environment compensation charge on the total cost of vehicles.</p>
<p>An apex court bench comprising Chief Justice T.S. Thakur, Justice A.K. Sikri and Justice R. Banumati passed the order after Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand submitted that the vehicles were required for VVIP security and law and order purposes.</p>
<p>Anand said the vehicles will also be required for transporting under-trial prisoners, collection of arms and ammunition, law and order duties, towing heavy vehicles like buses and trucks, patrolling and transporting animals for All-India Police Horse Shows.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Housing Board’s Chief Administrator Arun Kumar Gupta said, “I understand that it becomes uneconomical for the BPL class. I will check it.” <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777619&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2777638 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/haryana-housing-board759.jpg" alt="Haryana Housing Board, haryana bpl, haryana bpl housing, haryana housing board bpl allocation, haryana news, india news" /> A BPL beneficiary of a one-bed room flat on the first floor in Kurukshetra housing project, for instance, was issued an allotment letter on May 6, 2013 that the flat would cost him Rs 3,23,200.
<p>The Haryana Housing Board has slapped 3,109 eligible Below Poverty Line (BPL) flat allottes with a penal interest amounting to Rs 29 crore for no fault of theirs. The penalty has been imposed after the allotment of flats got delayed by two years due to a court case alleging illegal beneficiaries in the scheme.</p>
<p>The aggrieved beneficiaries have questioned the Board’s move of penalising them with the interest liability of around Rs 95,000 each despite being eligible and making payment of two installments in time. The penalty means that the prices of the flats will now escalate further.</p>
<p>A BPL beneficiary of a one-bed room flat on the first floor in Kurukshetra housing project, for instance, was issued an allotment letter on May 6, 2013 that the flat would cost him Rs 3,23,200.</p>
<p>Since the beneficiary had deposited an amount of Rs 74,000 in two installments earlier as the registration fee and the required amount after draw of lots, he was asked to deposit Rs 95,561 within 30 days and take possession of the flat. The beneficiary was to pay rest of the amount in monthly installments of Rs 1,487 over a period of 20 years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a petition was filed in the Punjab and Haryana High Court alleging that flats were alloted to ineligible persons. The court after observing that the Housing Board lacks clear-cut policy stayed the allotment process. The court later vacated the stay on July 28, 2015. But the Kurukshetra Estate Manager issued revised allotment letter to the beneficiary on March 21 this year directing him to deposit Rs 1,85,940, including Rs 94,696 as “interest liability due to non-payment (38 months),” within 30 days. The letter further reads, “failing which allotment will be cancelled after forfeited (sic) 50 per cent of allotment money.” The flat will now cost the “BPL allottee” Rs. 6.19 lakh.</p>
<p>An allottee, who did not want to be identified, said, “When we went to Kurukshetra Estate Manager in 2013, he said we will not be handed over the possession till the case is pending and said it is your will if you want to deposit the money or not .”</p>
<p>Housing Board’s Chief Administrator Arun Kumar Gupta said, “I understand that it becomes uneconomical for the BPL class. I will check it.”</p>
<p>At the same time, he reasoned, “Housing Board is not a profit-making organisation and somebody has to pay for the delay due to case pendency. Either the government pays the Board or it is recovered from the allottees.”</p>
<p>Other Housing Board officials agree that the penal interest has been levied unreasonably on the allottees without their fault and they might find it difficult to get possession. “It is irrational. These are flats for BPL and not for creamy class. But we have to follow instructions from the head office,” said SK Chauhan, Estate Manager, Kurukshetra.</p>

<p>Housing Board records reveal that except 531 flats in Kurukshetra, 405 in Yamuna Nagar and 55 in Amravati which were completed in 2013, completion report of 10 such projects for BPL class came earlier this year but beneficiaries of these flats have also been slapped the penal interest from a back date. Housing Board headquarter in Panchkula has recently sent files to 13 Estate Managers at various stations for allotment of 3,109 BPL flats adding penal rent liability . These are Dharuhera, Karnal, Fatehabad, Sirsa, Amravati, Narwana, Kurukshetra, Yamuna Nagar, Sonepat, Panipat, Ratia and Jhajjar.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2673808 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/badal-7591.jpg" alt="Punjab Deputy CM, Sukhbir Badal, Punjab BJP, Punjab SAD, punjab akali bjp allaince, punjab sad bjp alliance, punjab sad bjp govt, punjab news, india news" /> Sampla and Sukhbir have also reportedly agreed that there should be coordination between the office-bearers of both the parties where issues of mutual concern will be raised and addressed. (Express Photo)
<p>THE PUNJAB <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> leadership has started putting pressure on Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief and Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, to start filling up vacancies of the BJP quota of presidents of improvement trusts and chairmen of the market committees.</p>
<p>Sources said BJP state chief Vijay Sampla and Sukhbir held a series of meetings recently, two in New Delhi and two in Chandigarh, on several demands that the BJP has as the party motivates its middle rung leadership for the forthcoming polls. A senior BJP leader said the appointment of the Chief Parliamentary Secretaries (CPS) was also part of this process as the various appointments have been held in abeyance for a long time.</p>
<p>Sampla and Sukhbir have also reportedly agreed that there should be coordination between the office-bearers of both the parties where issues of mutual concern will be raised and addressed. This has been deemed necessary in order to do away with the ‘distrust’ that has cropped up in some instances between the cadres. Earlier, during massive membership enrollment drive launched by the BJP, the Akali cadres had alleged that their grassroots members were being ‘poached’ and this had led to some friction.</p>
<p>“The two leaders have also agreed that Sukhbir will address meetings of BJP workers in the coming days,” said the leader. Sampla has also impressed upon SAD leadership to ensure that the grievances of the BJP MLAs as well as party cadres are taken up by the district administrations as well as higher ups in the state government on an urgent basis. The latest meeting held on April 28 in Chandigarh was jointly chaired by Sampla and Sukhbir where the grievances of BJP MLAs were taken up.</p>
<p>The discussions over the seat-swapping arrangement between SAD and BJP in a few seats are also likely to take place in the coming days. “However, the issue is yet to be taken up at the level of Sukhbir and Sampla. But there are indications that the matter could be raised subsequently,” the senior BJP leader said.</p>
<p>In recent months there have been strong voices emanating from the BJP district-level workers in Batala that the seat which had been given to SAD should come back to the party. Speaking to <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>, a Batala-based BJP leader said,”Our party has a strong base in Batala and surrounding areas and we should encash this by getting the seat because SAD has not been able to hold it”. However, state level BJP leaders maintain that the number of seats that may be swapped would be small as there was not much margin on this front.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the efforts being made by the new BJP president to streamline the party internally as well as put its relationship with its alliance partner on an even keel, the thorny relations on some fronts are yet to be addressed. The open animosity between the senior Akali leadership and BJP Minister Anil Joshi in Tarn Taran is an example wherein in the recently held bypoll for Khadoor Sahib assembly seat, the Tarn Taran unit of BJP boycotted the polls and did not support the SAD candidate. Similarly, the open rebellion of the BJP MLA from Amritsar (East), Navjot Kaur Sidhu, over ties with SAD due to the ‘neglect’ of her constituency is yet another aspect that remains unaddressed.</p>

<p>Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Saturday said the previous UPA dispensation will have to answer who received the alleged kickbacks in the AgustaWestland chopper deal.</p>
<p>&#8220;The moot question is who took the money in Agusta deal. Those who were at the helm at the time when the deal was struck owe an explanation. The Italian court has clearly said that an amount of Rs 125 crore was paid. It has even disclosed some names. The government of that day needs to answer,&#8221; he told reporters on the sidelines of foundation laying ceremony in Dehradun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Investigations will make it clear how much in kickbacks was paid and to whom but the manner in which the deal was inked and efforts were made to favour a particular company will have to be explained by those in power at the time,&#8221; the Union Minister said.</p>
<p>However, he said he would not speak much on the issue as the matter is to be sorted out in Parliament. Parrikar was talking to reporters after laying the foundation stone of a memorial of martyrs (Shaheed Smarak) at Cheedbagh in the city. The deal for the choppers went off track in 2013 when Italy arrested the head of Finmeccanica, which owns AgustaWestland, for paying bribes to secure the deal.</p>

<p>An Italian court, which convicted AgustaWestland chief Giuseppe Orsi, had reportedly described how the firm paid bribes to top <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> leaders to bag the Rs.3,600 crore deal.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TO GET a first-hand knowledge of the impact of its populist schemes ahead of the 2017 assembly elections, Punjab is mulling over to take interactive voice response (IVR) system route to reach out to the beneficiaries of the schemes offered by various government departments.</p>
<p>A proposal for the same is likely to be put in the cabinet meeting scheduled Saturday.</p>
<p>Punjab government had earlier floated a tender to select an agency for the assessment of the outreach of various programmes of the government. The idea was to conduct a field impact study to evaluate the effectiveness of the schemes and get feedback to formulate new policies if needed.</p>

<p>An official told the only agency that came forward quot ed over Rs 30 crore for carrying out the study.</p>
<p>“The government has decided to take the IVR system route to reach out to the beneficiaries. We are likely to approach BSNL for the same. All the beneficiaries in all such schemes would be reached through IVR system. They will receive calls on their mobiles about the scheme and whether they actually were availing the scheme. There will be number of other parameters also. The beneficiaries would be able to register their responses through IVR system as they would be given choices through IVR to share their experience and feedback,” an official of Punjab government told <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“It is not easy to cover all the beneficiaries by any field study. So, it has been decided that IVR system is best suited to complete the task. There are lakhs of beneficiaries in schemes like Atta Dal scheme monitored by Food and Civil Supplies department, Pension scheme by Social Security department and schemes like farmers insurance and crops insurance and so on. The exercise would be completed in six months,” the official added.</p>

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
<p>“Depending upon the feedback, the scheme would be fine tuned,” said official. For example, the official added, in Mukh Mantri Tirath Yatra Scheme, there are inputs that pilgrims faced drinking water problems during the journey.</p>
<p>“That issue is being addressed now,” the official told.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777588&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>THE PUNJAB Police chargesheet against politician-cum-liquor baron Shiv Lal Doda in the Abohar murder case has a twist in the tale &#8211; it says an offence is made out against Doda but then adds that “scientific and technical investigations do not concretely link” him to the gruesome killing at his farmhouse.</p>
<p>The police have said that investigation by the Special Investigation Team (SIT), statements of witnesses, records of phone numbers with whom he had phone conversations and documents show that Doda was involved in the Bhim Taank murder case.</p>

<p>But the seven page chargesheet — copies of which are with <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> — adds that “the scientific and technical investigations do not concretely link Shiv Lal Doda” to the murder case.</p>
<p>After evading arrest for more than a month after the murder at his farmhouse of Bheem Taank, a Dalit youth, who had earlier worked for him in his liquor business, Doda surrendered before the Fazilka SSP on January 22, a day after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The police had slapped a case of criminal conspiracy against him.</p>
<p>In the chargesheet against Doda, police have cited a polygraph test report from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Delhi, that says he did not make any “deceptive responses” on questions that were posed to him and was “truthful”.</p>
<p>The SIT was led by Deputy Inspector General Ferozepur Range and comprised Fazilka SSP, Bathinda SP (Headquarters) and Abohar SP.</p>
<p>“The matter is in the court. I cannot comment on this,” said Fazilka Senior Superintendent of Police Narinder Bhargav.</p>
<p>The chargesheet said that samples of digital video recording related to the case had been sent to CFSL Chandigarh for examination and report would be submitted before the court once it was received. The chargesheet says four samples of digital video recording were collected from the farmhouse of Doda.</p>
<p>As many as 26 persons were booked in the case under various sections, including murder, criminal conspiracy and under sections of the SC/ST Act (Prevention of Atrocities) Act for the murderous attack on Taank in which another youth Gurjant Singh, who was accompanying him, was injured. The case was registered on the complaint of Gurjant’s brother Ranjit Singh.</p>
<p>The chargesheet says Ranjit Singh in his December 11 complaint stated that Taank, a former president of a transport union, had enmity with two people, who are among the accused, because they used to extort money from vehicle owners.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig">WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</a></strong></p>
[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
<p>Ranjit Singh said those two persons held a grudge against Taank. It adds that Doda and his nephew Amit Doda were booked for criminal conspiracy in the case after complainant Ranjit Singh further alleged that he “has learnt from his friends” that there was a conspiracy by Doda and his nephew Amit behind the murder of Taank and inflicting injuries to Gurjant Singh.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777567&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[“Please contact Chhotepur (for tickets). There is no need to waste your time on me. He is going to decide it, " H S Phoolka said in a video.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777536&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2777546 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/aap-punjab-phoolka759.jpg" alt="punjab, aam aadmi party, punjab aap, aap punjab, H S Phoolka, Sucha Singh Chhotepur, aap punjab news, india news, latest news" /> Phoolka was the party’s candidate from Ludhiana in 2014 <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/">Lok Sabha</a> polls. Though he was defeated by <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a>’ Ravneet Singh Bittu, he had swept the rural belt of Jagraon, an Akalis bastion, losing by a thin margin of over 19,000 votes.
<p>In clear-cut signs of rift in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), senior party leader and Supreme Court advocate H S Phoolka Friday said he had no standing in the party and that ticket-seekers in the party need not approach him.</p>
<p>Underlining that it was AAP state convenor Sucha Singh Chhotepur who runs the show in the party, Phoolka, in a video message he uploaded on all social media platforms, said: “Please contact Chhotepur (for tickets). There is no need to waste your time on me. He is going to decide it.</p>
<p>Chhotepur, meanwhile, told <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> that “it is extremely unfortunate that a senior AAP leader like Phoolka has displayed such kind of attitude”.</p>
<p>“I have no idea why is he upset. We respect him a lot. I would not like to say anything. Polls are approaching and our focus is on winning maximum seats in Punjab,” he said.</p>

<p>In the one-minute-27-second video, Phoolka has voiced strong resentment.</p>
<p>“Friends, the work to distribute tickets is on, it is gathering pace. People are asking for appointments from me. You people are reaching my Ludhiana and Delhi office. When I decline to meet you, the sentiment that goes out is that I am too arrogant and proud. But the fact is that I have no role in distributing tickets. This onus now lies on state convenor Sucha Singh Chotepur. Please contact him, he is the one who has the ultimate role to play,” he said.</p>
<p>Mincing no words that he has been marginalised in the party, he said “he was not a member in either of the committees formed for elections”.</p>
<p>“I am not a member of either the screening, campaigning or manifesto committee for Punjab. Neither am I member of national executive committee, National council or state committee. Like you, I am a small member of this party. Kindly do not waste your time on me. It is clear that Chhotepur is the supreme leader of the party now in Punjab so please go to him; he is going to finalise the tickets,” he said.</p>
<p>He also expressed his disappointment over his non-inclusion in the recently announced national executive of the party that has Chhotepur as ex-officio member. MPs Bhagwant Mann and Sadhu Singh from Sangrur and Faridkot, respectively, women’s wing head Baljinder Kaur and youth wing head Harjot Bains are also part of the national executive.</p>
<p>When contacted, Phoolka, who resigned from all party posts a few months ago citing that “he needs more time to focus on 1984 anti-Sikh riots court cases”, said, “I have just clarified that I have no say when it comes to ticket distribution. I have nothing against anyone but it is a fact that Chhotepur is state convenor and ticket aspirants should not waste their time on me.”</p>

(Source: PTI)
<p>A day after AAP national convenor <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/arvind-kejriwal/">Arvind Kejriwal</a> said Congress would be decimated in Punjab, state Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh said that Delhi CM was living in a “fool’s paradise.” “Like the PPP (Punjab People’s Party), the AAP will soon vanish into thin air,” he said, referring to the party that merged with the Congress last month.</p>
<p>“PPP leader Manpreet Badal still had integrity and credibility to his credit and he was the son of the soil and Kejriwal lacks in all these attributes.”</p>

<p>Kejriwal had Thursday said AAP would bag 107 seats in Assembly polls in Punjab slated for next year. “I am surprised why did he not claim 117 out of 117 because that could have suited and sounded much better for him,” said Amarinder.</p>
<p>The PCC president pointed out that since 2014, when AAP won four parliamentary seats in Punjab, it had split vertically with two MPs already having revolted. “Besides, the two byelections it contested, its candidates had to forfeit the security deposit in both. After that, it did not dare to contest any byelection.”</p>
<p>“If you have really started believing that you are going to sail on the political deadwood you have been importing from other parties, may God bless you as you are doomed and destined to drown. No matter how much you try to polish it, deadwood will always remain deadwood only,” said Amarinder.</p>
<p>He said compared to Rs 20 crore annual advertisement budget of Sheila Dixit’s government in Delhi, Kejriwal had allocated Rs 620 crore for advertisements. “And all that money he was spending in Punjab only to spread lies and befool people here.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777462&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2777438 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/water-759.jpg" alt="pune, pune water, maharashtra, maharashtra water, water, water in pune, pune news, india news" /> There has been a consistent increase in the water contamination levels as the analysis of drinking water samples in the Pune circle.
<p>A state public health laboratory has found increasing levels of contamination in drinking water whose samples were taken from villages in Pune and Solapur.</p>
<p>Analysis of 1,223 drinking water samples taken in March from Pune district has revealed a 21 per cent contamination, according to the data given by the laboratory.</p>
<p>The data showed that while there was almost negligible contamination in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation areas, at Solapur urban and rural areas, and villages in Pune, the level of contamination was high. Out of 540 drinking water samples — 86 were contaminated in Solapur urban areas, managed by the municipal authorities, while another 255 samples out of 1,077 taken in March, were found to be contaminated in the rural areas of Solapur.</p>
<p>There has been a consistent increase in the water contamination levels as the analysis of drinking water samples in the Pune circle — comprising Pune, Satara and Solapur— indicate. For instance from April 2015 till February this year, a total of 15,026 drinking water samples were collected from Pune district’s 13 tehsils and sent to public health laboratory at Pune for testing. A total of 2,993 were found to be contaminated. In the Pune Municipal Corporation area, however, from among 65,984, drinking water samples tested a total of 62 were contaminated.</p>
<p>In Solapur’s villages, however, from April 2015 till February this year out of 15,942 drinking water samples, a total of 2,020 were contaminated while Solapur urban areas found contamination in 682 out of 5,480 drinking water samples for the same period.</p>
<p>Dr H H Chavan, Deputy Director, Pune circle, said the health department routinely undertakes bacteriological and chemical tests to ascertain the water quality in villages. “Although there been no outbreak, we have directed the health officers to issue guidelines to manage the contamination of the water sources,” Chavan said.</p>
<p>Dr Bhagwan Pawar, Pune district health officer said there are 1,400 villages in Pune district and it is the responsibility of the gram panchayats to provide potable water to them. We have sent letters to the block development officers to explain why the water samples have been found contaminated. Mainly, the drinking water sources get contaminated from sewage water or due to leakages in pipes.</p>
<p>According to Dr Sunil Bhadkumbe, Solapur district health officer samples can have E-coli due to foecal contamination.</p>
<p><strong>No samples from Panchgani, Chakan</strong></p>
<p>Pune: Panchgani municipal council and Chakan municipal council in Satara and Pune respectively failed to submit their water samples for the quality surveillance measures and were listed as defaulters while Rajgurunagar municipal council in Pune and Mangalvedha in Solapur were detected with more than 10 per cent water contamination. However, Solapur municipal corporation, was adjudged the worst as in the urban areas as it had registered 16 per cent water contamination.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2763031 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/maurya-759.jpg" alt="bjp, bjp uttar pradesh, uttar pradesh, up, up rss, bjp in up, uttar pradesh polls, uttar pradesh news, india news" /> Uttar Pradesh <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> President Keshav Prashad Maurya. (File/PTI)
<p>The new BJP state committee, which will likely be in place by May 10, would reportedly see several youths with RSS background, with new party president Keshav Prasad Maurya already seeking instructions from the party top brass in the matter.</p>
<p>The party top brass allegedly has its eye on the new team, as its members would play a crucial part in the 2017 Assembly polls.</p>
<p>Party sources said the new team would have leaders with RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal and ABVP backgrounds. “The members of the new team will be selected by party state in-charge Om Mathur, the state president, national joint general secretary (organisation) Shiv Prakash and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal. These four men are RSS full-timers. In view of the 2017 polls, they could rely on those who are young and have worked for RSS for a long time,” said a senior leader.</p>
<p>“By appointing Maurya, who is young, aggressive and has a RSS background, as the state chief, party national president Amit Shah has given an indication about the faces,” he added.</p>
<p>In the current state team of 33 members, state vice-presidents — Shiv Pratap Shukla, Haridwar Dube and Ashok Katariya — general secretary Swatantra Deo Singh, secretary Anoop Gupta, treasurer Rajesh Agrawal, spokesperson Chandra Mohan and Sunil Bansal are full-time RSS workers.</p>
<p>When contacted, Maurya claimed: “The new state committee will be a balanced team of persons having organisational experience, aggressiveness and ability to struggle for the cause of the party and public.”</p>
<p>On leaders with RSS background being included in the team, he said: “Workers lead the BJP and the party gives regard and honour to all of them. Workers will get an opportunity to serve the party.” When asked about the need to include Dalits in the team, Maurya maintained BJP does not discriminate on caste lines.</p>
<p>Maurya, who himself has served in the VHP for over 10 years, said he will declare the state team very soon.</p>
<p>Sources said the party needs youth leaders to reach out to the grassroots level before the state elections. “Youth leaders are also required to hold agitations against the failures of the SP government. It has been a long time since the party’s youth wing staged an agitation in Lucknow or any other part of the state on public issues,” said a leader.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777368&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2563340 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/11/congress759.jpg" alt="congress, uttar pradesh, dalit, dalit votes,up bypolls, uttar pradesh bypolls, congress news, india news, uttar pradesh news" /> <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> had not contested the seat in 2012 Assembly polls, leaving it for its then alliance partner Rashtriya Lok Dal.
<p>When Bilari votes to elect its new MLA on May 16, the Assembly constituency in Moradabad will also handover a judgment to the Congress party. The electorate will be the first to test and give verdict on Congress’s latest exercise — the Dalit Leadership Programme — that the party has undertaken as one of the several measures for its revival ahead of the Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh next year.</p>
<p>Congress has fielded a Dalit, a former BSP worker who had joined the party in February, to contest against a backward class candidate and a Muslim candidate, fielded by <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> and Samajwadi Party, respectively.</p>
<p>The seat had fallen vacant after sitting Samajwadi Party MLA Hazi Irfan died in a road accident. Congress had not contested the seat in 2012 Assembly polls, leaving it for its then alliance partner Rashtriya Lok Dal.</p>

<p>Sources in the party informed with BSP announcing not to contest the bypolls, Congress has planned to check its formula of “Dalit-Muslim” combination, which it also plans to implement in 2017 polls.</p>
<p>Congress had fielded Shishu Pal Singh Jatav from the seat. Jatav, who a BSP worker in Moradabad, was brought in the Congress as part part of party’s ‘Dalit Leadership Programme’. Under this programme, the Congress has spent months across constituencies identifying new Dalit faces ahead of the state polls next year.</p>
<p>Admitting that it fielding Jatav in Bilari is a part of their new experiment, Bhagwati Chaudhary, chairman of the UP Congress SC department, said, “We have no hesitation in saying that he came into the party recently during our exercise to bring in active Dalit faces, who could emerge as leaders.”</p>
<p>“So, when the two byelections were announced, party decided to experiment with fielding a Jatav face on a general seat. We might not win but the vote share in this election will help us define our future strategy,” he added.</p>
<p>In 2012, SP’s Hazi Irfan, who had won from the seat, was given a close fight by BSP’s Laxmi Singh Saini. While Irfan had got about 55,694 votes, BSP candidate had got 54,154 votes. The RLD candidate, who was supported by Congress, could get only about 10,000 votes.</p>
<p>“Congress has given a chance to a Jatav face like me on a general seat. There are considerable Jatav votes here and we hope to get it in our favour along with the Muslim vote as BSP is not contesting here. Only time will tell whether things will go as predicted,” Shishupal Singh Jatav told <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>.</p>
<p>He said that Congress is promoting Dalit leadership, which even BSP chief Mayawati could not do and party has planned to use the strategy in the upcoming Assembly elections too.</p>
<p>While BJP has fielded a backward candidate Suresh Saini, as part of its own strategy hoping to target non-Yadav backward votes, Samajwadi Party is hoping to gain on sympathy vote as it has fielded Hazi Irfan’s son Faheem.</p>
<p>In other Assembly seat, Jangipur, also going for bypolls on May 16, Congress has fielded Shailesh Singh, party’s district president from Ghazipur. Singh had contested on the seat in the past.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777297&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[This elicited loud protests from Congress MPs, forcing deputy chairman P J Kurien to adjourn the House for five minutes.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777263&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2639797 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/cattle-main.jpg" alt="cattle smuggling, BSF, india, bangladesh, india-bangladesh border, cow smuggling, bull smuggling, sunday story, sunday story cattle smuggling" /> This elicited loud protests from <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> MPs, forcing deputy chairman P J Kurien to adjourn the House for five minutes.
<p>The Upper House witnessed a brief stand-off between the Opposition and the government Friday over the killing of two cattle traders in Jharkhand’s Latehar district, with the former demanding the setting up of a House committee to probe the incident and submit a report to Parliament.</p>
<p>However, the government — represented by Minority Affairs ministers Najma Heptulla and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi — claimed that the Opposition was resorting to exaggeration and that it will first ascertain facts by writing to the Chief Minister of the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a>-ruled state.</p>
<p>This elicited loud protests from Congress MPs, forcing deputy chairman P J Kurien to adjourn the House for five minutes.</p>
<p>The MPs were referring to the death of two Muslim cattle traders, one of whom was a teenager, in March. Their bodies were found hanging from a tree with hands tied in Jhabbar village in Jharkhand’s Latehar district. The state police subsequently arrested five men, including one with links to a local gau raksha samiti (an outfit for protection<br />
of cows).</p>

<p>The Opposition’s offensive was led by Congress’s Ghulam Nabi Azad, JD(U)’s Sharad Yadav and CPM’s Sitaram Yechury, with all three accusing Heptulla and Naqvi of insensitivity. “This is a serious issue and the way they (the ministers) have responded&#8230; You are taking this too casually,” Yadav said.</p>
<p>The matter was first raised by JD(U)’s Ghulam Rasool Balyavi during the Zero Hour. “They were part of an old trade of buying and selling cattle&#8230;They were brutally hanged. I think even the British did not do this to Indians,” he said.<br />
Balyavi then alleged that the victims’ relatives were beaten up at the police station and told to go back to Pakistan. “Who are they to ask us to go back to Pakistan,” he asked, following which many Opposition MPs joined him in support.</p>
<p>But ruckus broke out immediately after Naqvi’s response to Balyavi. “The member made an emotional speech&#8230; but what is the truth&#8230; Yet, I will talk to the state government about the allegation,” he said, adding, “But we can’t say anything that will destroy the communal harmony of that state.”</p>
<p>At this moment, Kurien intervened to remind Naqvi that a minister has to take whatever an MP says at “face value”. This prompted Heptulla to jump to her colleague’s rescue. “Sir, you are absolutely right, but we have to substantiate what has been said. We’ll write to the CM and get the facts about what happened. But I’ll also request the members to not get so emotional,” said Heptulla, which again sent the Opposition into a tizzy.</p>
<p>Congress and JD(U) MPs entered the Well and raised slogans, demanding the dismissal of Jharkhand government.<br />
Azad slammed the government for “failing” to protect minority communities. Yechury then suggested that the Upper House constitute a House Committee to visit the district and probe the incident and asked Kurien to forward the request to chairman Hamid Ansari.</p>
<p>“It is two months since this incident has happened. The government did not do anything&#8230; it is a communal issue, it comes under the domain of national issues,” Yechury said.</p>
<p>Naqvi, meanwhile, continued defending the government’s stand and called for a debate on the communal situation in the country. “The game of communalism that is going on in the name of secularism&#8230; We request you to have a debate on the communal atmosphere in the country, things will be clear then,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777263&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gehlot said: “We have finalised the draft of the Bill and it has been approved by the Law Department. A Cabinet note has already been circulated. Our effort will be to place it before the Cabinet at the next meeting and take it forward.” He said the Bill passed by Rajya Sabha had many procedural difficulties and the government felt it should bring its own Bill. He favoured a wider debate so that all related issues are considered. However, he declared that the government was committed to protect the interest of transgenders.</p>
<p>BJD group leader Bhartruhari Mahtab suggested that the Bill be withdrawn considering that the government was planning to bring forward its own legislation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777258&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>In March, the government had to suffer embarrassment in Rajya Sabha when the Opposition managed to pass an amendment to the President’s address, expressing regret that the speech did not commit support to rights of all citizens to contest panchayat elections. The move had come after Rajasthan and Haryana passed laws fixing matriculation as an essential criteria for contesting polls.</p>
<p>On Friday, Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, who had moved the amendment, introduced a private member’s bill in the Upper House to amend the Constitution.</p>
<p>The bill seeks to insert an Article in the Constitution to override the Haryana and Rajasthan legislations by making the right to contest for electoral office a fundamental right.</p>

<p>Although private member’s bills have rarely sailed through in Parliament, the opposition has a majority in the Upper House and could manage to push through the bill, potentially embarrassing the government. The amendment to President’s address had received the support of many opposition parties.</p>
<p>Azad’s bill is politically significant since the Congress had been campaigning against restrictions imposed in Rajasthan and Haryana. Congress vice-president <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/rahul-gandhi/">Rahul Gandhi</a> has also attacked the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> over the issue.</p>
<p>“A huge number of members from the Scheduled Castes, especially women — since there is 50 per cent reservation for them —could not contest because of the restriction. Many Muslim women could not contest either. The most affected are SC and Muslim women. In Rajasthan, there were huge vacancies and they had to conduct elections again&#8230; There is no educational qualification for becoming president or prime minister of India or to become a cabinet minister or an MLA,” Azad said.</p>
<p>A private member&#8217;s bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha last year after a gap of 45 years. Only 14 private member’s bills have been passed by Parliament till date.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777260&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Express Photo by Gajendra yadav,21/03/2015" /> <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> Leader and former union minister Dr. Subramanian Swamy Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav
<p>SUBRAMANIAN SWAMY ended his first week in Rajya Sabha Friday by moving a privilege motion against Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad and challenging removal of his comments against <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> president <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/">Sonia Gandhi</a> from Parliament records.</p>
<p>Swamy has accused Azad of “wilfully misleading the House” by stating that the UPA government had blacklisted helicopter manufacturer AgustaWestland and its parent company Finmeccanica after allegations of bribery and kickbacks surfaced against them and that this decision was reversed by the NDA II. He also sought a short discussion on media reports that money was allegedly paid to middlemen for managing Indian journalists to produce favourable reports for the deal.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I have also filed a Notice in RS challenging the expunging of my words by Dy Chmn since it is arbitrary unreasonable and against RS Rules</p>
<p>— Subramanian Swamy (@Swamy39) <a href="http://twitter.com/Swamy39/status/725869826766303232">April 29, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Swamy’s first two days in Rajya Sabha were eventful with Deputy Chairman P J Kurien censoring his comments twice and even warning him of action for “unnecessarily provoking” the Opposition with constant references to Sonia, linking her to the AgustaWestland deal and her Italian background. He challenged Kurien’s decision Friday, saying it was “unreasonable” and “arbitrary”.</p>
<p>Although he refrained from making any controversial statements , his privilege motion against Azad had the Opposition protesting again, albeit briefly. The Upper House witnessed commotion in Zero Hour when he drew Kurien’s attention towards the motion.</p>
<p>Later, Swamy called for a discussion on the news that Indian journalists were paid to write favourably on AgustaWestland. “Now the paid news has acquired the character of a cancer in our democracy. Recently in the AgustaWestland deal also. Perhaps one of the news channels had published a contract, which was signed between the middlemen and the company for managing the Indian media to produce favourable reports on the deal,” he said.</p>

<p>BUSINESS IN Rajya Sabha collapsed Friday and the House had to be adjourned due to lack of quorum, exposing lack of seriousness of members towards private members’ legislative business.</p>
<p>The House resumed in the afternoon five minutes late at 2.35 pm due to lack of quorum. Deputy Chairman P J Kurien said the delay was because of “no quorum”.</p>
<p>When Jairam Ramesh said ensuring quorum was the “minister’s responsibility,” Kurien replied, “Yes, yes. You should ensure more members are present.”</p>

<p>The House then took up discussion on a Bill moved by K V P Ramachandra Rao to amend Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. As soon as MoS, Home Affairs, Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary replied to the Bill and sought its withdrawal, TDP’s C M Ramesh raised the issue of quorum that led to heated arguments.</p>
<p>With some members arguing that quorum is required only during voting, V P Singh Badnore, who was in the Chair, said any member can raise the issue of quorum at any time.</p>
<p>He rang the quorum bell to call members to be present in House and amid exchanges, adjourned the House at 4.15 pm. Generally, the House is adjourned at 5 pm on Fridays.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777244&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI/File)
<p>The <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/panama-papers/">Panama Papers</a> featured in the Question Hour Friday as the government said it has issued notices to all those who have been named in reports carried by <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>.</p>
<p>“But tax laws in the country mandate that the names and details of the proceedings cannot be made public till cases are filed in courts,” Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/">Lok Sabha</a> while replying to a question from <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> MP Kirit Somaiya. Jaitley explained that Section 138 of the Income Tax Act bars the proceedings of a case to be made public till a case is filed in court.</p>
<p>Responding to another supplementary, Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha said the government is looking into the HSBC list as well as The Panama Papers, and various laws, including the one on black money stashed abroad, are being invoked.</p>

<p>Acting on The Panama Papers leak, the I-T department has sent a questionnaire to about 50 individuals and entities that figure on the list of those who allegedly have offshore assets in tax havens. In the questionnaire, the I-T department has sought to know if the person is indeed the same as the one named in the list, which was carried by The Indian Express.</p>

<p>It also seeks to know about vitals of their transactions with law firm Mossack Fonseca. This includes the year of incorporation, their source of income, details of business transactions and whether they declared these investments and transactions to the I-T department and other regulatory bodies like the RBI.</p>
<p>There are about 500 Indians named in the list, including prominent businessmen, film celebrities and politicians.</p>
<p>The government has created a Multi-Agency Group of probe agencies — the I-T department, its foreign tax wing, the RBI, the Financial Intelligence Unit and the Enforcement Directorate — to look into the cases.</p>
<p>The Panama Papers leak brought to light an unprecedented amount of information, including more than 11 million documents covering 2,10,000 companies in 21 offshore jurisdictions. Each transaction spans different jurisdictions and may involve multiple entities and individuals.</p>
<p>Sinha also said that the Special Investigation Team on black money has made a series of recommendations on the issue.</p>

<p><em>During Zero Hour on Friday, BJP MP Udit Raj raised the issue of MPs ‘losing their influence’. He talks to <strong>Avishek G Dastidar</strong> about what prompted him to raise the issue.</em></p>
<p><strong>Why do you say MPs are losing influence?</strong></p>
<p>As an MP, we write countless letters to various ministries for getting many things of public interest done. I have noticed that over the years, the amount of work getting done following letters from MPs is decreasing.</p>
<p><strong>How can you make such a sweeping statement?</strong></p>
<p>I can tell you from my own experience. Since January 2016, I have written 1,940 letters to various ministries demanding or requesting something or the other of public interest.</p>
<p>In reply, I have got around 500 letters. Almost none of them are positive. They mostly reply saying either the matter is being looked into or that the job cannot be done. This was not the case earlier.</p>

<p><strong>So, this is a new trend?</strong></p>
<p>I have been noticing this decreasing influence of MPs’ letters to ministries for the last 15 years. I must say, I used to get more work done through letters when I was not an MP. And mine is not an isolated case. If you noticed, almost every MP associated with what I said in <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/">Lok Sabha</a> today. This means they have also felt it.</p>
<p><strong>Who or what is responsible for this?</strong></p>
<p>The bureaucracy has become arrogant now. Politicians have become weak. This is because the policy paralysis of the UPA government gave all the power to the Judiciary, which started dictating terms to the government and getting work done through bureaucrats. As a result, in the eyes of the bureaucracy, the MPs and politicians became less relevant and less powerful.</p>
<p>This is now reflected in the casual way MPs’ letters are disposed of by ministries. It is like what Modiji told Parliament once, that when politicians fight among each other, the bureaucrats enjoy a free run.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the solution?</strong></p>
<p>A central online database should be created of all letters from public representatives and it should be publicly accessible. That way, the minister concerned can also see for himself how many requests his ministry received from which MP, and what is the status of those requests.</p>
<p>This way, there would be less chance of an MP’s request getting ignored or lost because some babus decided to attach less importance to it.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777246&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>THE DEVELOPMENTS on the issue of the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) found their way into the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/">Lok Sabha</a> Friday as MPs from both sides of the political divide demanded that the scheduled May 1 exam be postponed.</p>
<p>Members from the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a>, <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a>, Shiv Sena and other smaller parties said the exam on May 1, being held as the first phase of NEET, would leave aspirants with almost no time to prepare. They demanded that the exam be held on July 24, the scheduled date for the second phase of the exam.</p>
<p>“This affects the lives of lakhs of children. Students would be in great stress due to this decision. I would appeal to the government to combine the two tests and hold a single test on July 24,” BJP MP Jagdambika Pal said during Zero Hour. Many BJP MPs seconded him.</p>

<p>Congress MP Rajiv Satav said the government should find legal recourse to ensure that the new system is implemented from 2018, which will give states “two years’ time to prepare for it”.</p>
<p>Satav said if a legal remedy is not found then the government should at least allow all aspirants to appear on July 24 so that students get some time to prepare.</p>
<p>Shiv Sena’s Arvind Sawant said students from various state education boards — as opposed to CBSE — might benefit from getting some more time to prepare for the test.</p>

<p>THE SUPREME Court Friday declined to issue any urgent order to modify its directive to hold the common all-India medical entrance test in two phases even as the central government cited “practical difficulties” in conducting the exam for the 2016-17 session.</p>
<p>“We passed our order after hearing all the parties. We will not examine this again now. Let the exams continue,” a bench led by Justice Anil R Dave told Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand.</p>
<p>The bench said the aggrieved parties can file their applications, which would be heard in due course when the case comes up next for regular hearing. The matter is now listed for hearing on May 3.</p>
<p>In the morning, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, along with the ASG, requested the bench that it was difficult to hold the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) this year in two phases as state medical entrance exams were already scheduled.</p>

<p>He pointed out some exams had already taken place, while the rest were coming up. Rohatgi suggested that the NEET should happen jointly on July 24 and the state medical exams could be conducted in the meantime. The AG said there was a need to modify the Thursday order since a lot of confusion was created regarding validity of the state medical exams.</p>
<p>Responding to this, the court said it would not go into all that as of now but agreed to consider if an urgent hearing could be granted to the parties on Friday.</p>
<p>However, in the afternoon, Justice Dave declined to issue any urgent directions on modifying the court’s Thursday order and said it would not be possible to give a hearing to the Centre and a few states which wanted a green signal for their medical exams.</p>
<p>“We are not having the bench. Let the exam go on. Let them file the applications,” said Justice Dave, who heads the special bench hearing the NEET case.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the court had fixed the timeline for conducting the NEET for admissions to MBBS and BDS courses and clarified that its directive will supersede all other orders relating to medical admissions.</p>
<p>With this clarification, the three-judge bench had made it unequivocal that all other admission tests, already held or scheduled for later, for admission to government colleges, deemed universities, private medical colleges, minority and linguistic minority colleges, stand scrapped.</p>
<p>The schedule was submitted jointly by the Union Health Ministry, CBSE and the Medical Council of India (MCI).<br />
According to the schedule, the All India Pre-Medical Test (AIPMT) scheduled for May 1 will be treated as first round of the NEET.</p>
<p>However, those who have not applied for AIPMT will be given opportunity to appear in round two on July 24. The combined result will be declared on August 17, in order to complete the admission process by September 30 — the deadline set by the apex court in its previous orders.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777231&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The affidavit, filed in March 2011, mentioned that the building had been constructed “without prior approval under CRZ notification”.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777241&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

<p>WHILE STANDING by its decision to demolish the building, the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) had, in 2011, said that the construction of the Adarsh building was “unauthorised and illegal”. In an affidavit filed by the deputy director of MoEF, in response to the society challenging the ministry’s decision of demolishing the building, it had stated that “the society and all the members were aware of illegalities but nevertheless continued construction”.</p>
<p>The affidavit, filed in March 2011, also mentioned that the building had been constructed “without prior approval under Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification of 1991”.</p>
<p>“The CRZ notification lists out various activities, including construction activities which require clearance from ministry, state authority or other agencies. All construction of more than Rs 5 crore is regulated by the CRZ notification. No permission has been obtained from the MoEF through the Urban Development department under the CRZ notification,” the affidavit said.</p>

<p>The affidavit goes on to say that an Urban Development department letter dated March 2003, signed by P V Deshmukh, one of the flat beneficiaries, falsely records that MoEF had communicated their ‘no objection’ to allow development of the society.</p>
<p>The society further used Floor Space Index (FSI) in excess of what is permitted, according to the MoEF.</p>
<p>“A government memorandum of August 8, 2005, subjects the rights of the society to use the FSI from the BEST plot (the plot adjacent to the Adarsh society) upon change made to the development plan in the designation from BEST depot to residential zone and permissions from the MoEF and the MMRDA. They did not apply for the same permission. They are therefore not entitled to utilise the FSI available from BEST plot,” said the MoEF, adding that it is not permissible for a party to utilise FSI of adjoining plot by amalgamation of that plot.</p>

<p>MEMBERS OF the Adarsh Housing Society have said they will approach the Supreme Court against the Bombay High Court order to demolish the building. Society members termed the HC order ‘harsh’ and said they are waiting for the detailed copy to appeal further. The High Court has given the society 12 weeks to approach the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Chief Promoter RC Thakur said the society was not illegal and had received the requisite clearances. “We are shocked (by the order). The MMRDA authorities had given the building all clearances, including the Occupancy Certificate. So if it is ordered to be demolished now, who is responsible? The society has 60 per cent members belonging to the Army, who bought the flats with their hard-earned money, many through their pension fund. How are they at fault?” Thakur said.</p>

<p>Thakur added that demolishing the 31-storey building cannot be the only solution. “If it is alleged that people have been given membership erroneously, they can be expelled. The land on which the building is built is not an encroachment. We trust the judicial process and will approach the SC after reading the detailed order,” said Thakur.</p>
<p>The society members had termed the demolition order passed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2011 as ‘malafide’, maintaining they had all clearances.</p>
<p>Former BMC commissioner Jairaj Phatak also said the society office-bearers will decide after receiving the order on whether to approach the Supreme Court. “Even in the case of another building in Mumbai, the Supreme Court had granted relief to the society. Similarly, the MoEF itself has given relief to violations in seeking environment clearances,” Phatak said.</p>
<p>The MoEF in January 2011 had ordered that the building be demolished for violating coastal regulation laws. Within a month, the society had moved court for relief. “We are being entangled in a political fight. This is not fair to the society’s other members,” said a member not wishing to be named.</p>

(Express Photo: Abhijit Alka Anil)
<p>The Bombay High Court directive to demolish the controversial Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society, an illegal building in Mumbai, has come as a setback to the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> trying to revive its political fortunes under the leadership of former chief minister Ashok Chavan in Maharashtra.</p>
<p>Chavan’s political rehabilitation was the outcome of support from Congress VP <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/rahul-gandhi/">Rahul Gandhi</a>. After the 2014 <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/">Lok Sabha</a> and Assembly routs, the party had decided to bring back Ashok Chavan to lead the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee.</p>
<p>On Friday, the court directed the Centre-state government to start proceedings against all the politicians and bureaucrats involved in the multi-crore Adarsh scam. The names include that of Ashok Chavan, facing charges for violating rules and nepotism by allotting flats to relatives.</p>

<p>Sources in the MPCC said, “Ashok Chavan’s case is pending in the apex court. He has always maintained that he had not done any wrong in the Adarsh society.”</p>

<p>Political managers in the party said, “We may absolve individuals, but cannot justify Adarsh, which has exposed the deep nexus between politicians and bureaucrats.”</p>
<p>A senior party functionary said, “Former environment minister Jairam Ramesh had clearly stated violation of environment rules in the Adarsh Housing&#8230;”</p>
<p>The scam in the 31 storeyed structure with 102 flats has exposed 23 benami transactions, and involvement of 12 IAS officers who violated the code of conduct, along with the role of former chief ministers late Vilasrao Deshmukh, Sushil Kumar Shinde and Ashok Chavan.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a>-led government, after consulting the Centre, will take a formal decision on the fate of Adarsh building. A senior officer said, “We have 12 weeks’ time. But we would go by court directives.” The departmental probe against IAS officials is already in progress. Governor C H Vidyasagar Rao gave the sanction to the Central Bureau of Investigation to prosecute former chief minister Ashok Chavan in February, 2016.</p>

<p>In 2014, the Congress-NCP government had partially accepted the Adarsh Commission Report, which exposed rampant corruption and a nexus between top politicians and bureaucrats who bent rules to serve their own interests. Despite serious indictments, the government gave a clean chit to all politicians and ordered an internal departmental probe against 12 bureaucrats. In 2014, the then governor K Shankaranarayanan had refused permission to CBI to prosecute Ashok Chavan.</p>
<p><strong>From the archives:</strong> <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/in-oct-defence-audit-questioned-allotment-of-land-to-highrise/">In Oct,defence audit questioned allotment of land to highrise</a></p>
<p>On November 9, 2010, Ashok Chavan was forced to resign as chief minister for allocating flats to close relatives. He was replaced with Prithviraj Chavan from the PMO, known for his upright image. Ashok Chavan is accused of giving permissions in violation of rules. He is accused of non-deduction of 15 per cent recreational ground while calculating FSI. The commission noted that it cannot be treated as innocent. It cannot be a sheer coincidence in the backdrop of all processes that his three relatives apply and get flats in the same society, it said.</p>
<p><strong>Ashok Chavan’s relatives who got flats</strong></p>
<p>Former chief minister Ashok Chavan’s three relatives got flats in Adarsh, Chavan’s mother-in-law Bhagwati Sharma, his father-in-law’s bother Madanlal Sharma and sister-in-law Seema Sharma.</p>
<p><strong>Bureaucrats who violated conduct rules</strong></p>
<p>There were 12 bureaucrats facing investigation for their role in Adarsh. They include Subash Lalla (former secretary to CM); Pradeep Vyas (ex-collector Mumbai); Jairaj Phatak (ex-BMC commissioner); Ramanand Tiwari (ex-principal secretary Urban development); C S Sangitrao (ex-secretary to CM); D K Sankaran (former chief secretary); I A Kundan (ex-collector), Thomas Benjamin (former principal secretary, urban development); P V Deshmukh (deputy secretary urban development), Suresh Joshi (former commissioner MMRDA), T Chandrashekhar (former MMRDA chief); Umesh Luktuke (former chief town and country planner).</p>
<p><strong>Cases of benami flats</strong></p>
<p>Of the total 102 members, 25 were found ineligible. It included 22 benami transactions. The list of such candidates includes Abhay Sancheti related to Ajay Sancheti (MP) in Rajya Sabha from BJP, considered close to union minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/nitin-gadkari/">Nitin Gadkari</a>. It also includes the name of Madanlal Sharma (related to Ashok Chavan).</p>
<p><strong>What were major violations in Adarsh?</strong></p>
<p>Adarsh CHS had never applied to MoEF for CRZ clearance, which was mandatory. The land was under CRZ-II. The sanction to the highrise building to raise the height to 97.60 mts was not in accordance with rules. There was non-compliance of rules while proposing to reduce width of Capt Prakash Peth Marg from 60.97 metres to 18.40 metres.</p>
<p>The membership was arbitrary and lacked transparency. Verification of membership applications at the collector’s office was not done properly.</p>

Eight persons had been named in the killing of Mahtab, a former AMU student. (Source: Express photo by Ravi Kanojia)
<p>Police Friday arrested a research scholar of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) in connection with the last week’s violence on the campus and identified 15 others who had allegedly indulged in arson and firing which resulted in the death of two persons.</p>
<p>Based on CCTV footage, police identified the troublemakers, some of them former students, who had set the Proctor’s office and the Dean Students’ Welfare (DSW) office on fire. A four-wheeler was also burnt down that Saturday night.</p>
<p>Research scholar Mohammad Zoraiz (28) had led the group that clashed with another group of outsiders, SHO, Civil Lines Police Station, Surya Kant Dwivedi said. The arrested scholar’s wife is a teacher with one of the schools on the campus. The couple lives in a rented accommodation in Safariya locality close to the university.</p>
<p>Following the identification, the university administration suspended 12 of them, including Zoraiz, for their alleged involvement in the violence and the murders.</p>

<p>Police will now move court to seek non-bailable warrants against those identified from the footage.</p>
<p>The violence on Saturday, result of a clash between the two rival groups, had claimed the lives of Mehtab (22) and Mohammad Waqif (18). While the university had expelled Mehtab last year on charges of indiscipline, Waqif lived near the campus and was a Class XII pass-out.</p>
<p>SSP K Ravinder Gaur said that the Special Investigation Team had been tracking the movements of Zoraiz, a native of Amroha district who had gone into hiding since the violence. He was arrested from a hideout in Aligarh Thursday and produced before the court which sent him to judicial custody.</p>
<p>“Zoraiz has been booked in six of the 11 cases registered in connection with the violence and murders of the two youths. Efforts are on to arrest the others,” the SHO said.</p>
<p>With fresh evidence against the students coming out, AMU Proctor Professor Mohsin Khan Friday said in a statement that 12 of the students identified by the police have been suspended with immediate effect on charges of committing acts of “gross misconduct and indiscipline”. The AMU campus and its institutions have also been placed out of bound for them, he said.</p>
<p>Besides Zoraiz, the other suspended include Mohammad Mohsin Iqbal (MA), Faheem Akhtar (PhD), Azhar Amani Vazir (BSW), Mohammad Sadiq (BE-Civil), Mohammad Sohaib (BCom), Mohammad Amir Khan (BCom), Mohammad Amir Khan alias Chaudhary (MA), Mohammad Khalid Ali and Zaidul Islam Sherwani (BA-LLB), Shahzaman Khan alias Shaikhu (PhD) and Amir Khan (MCom).</p>
<p>The Proctor said that the Provosts of the Halls of Residence have been asked to ensure that rooms where these students had been staying are vacated immediately.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2777233" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/agusta.jpg" alt="vvip chopper scam, AgustaWestland deal, middleman Middleman Michel, AgustaWestland deal, AgustaWestland scam, AgustaWestland deal probe, Guido Haschke, Carlo Gerosa, VVIP Chopper deal, chopper scam, P Tyagi, vvip chopper scam, agusta westland scam, india chopper scam, vvip scam, india news, latest news " /> He wrote on affidavit with Haschke on 30-million-Euro commissions.
<p>While the roles played by Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa and their links to the Tyagi brothers have been amply clarified by the Milan court, Christian Michel, the third middleman in the AgustaWestland case, remains a key, shadowy player whose role is only now beginning to unravel.</p>
<p>In an interview to The Hindu, Michel claimed he had no hand in the helicopter scam, had signed no document and that the so-called “budget” to buy favours from persons in the Ministry of Defence, including procurement, the Air Force, bureaucrats, the Tyagi “family” as well as politicians (including the intriguing AP) had been penned by his associate Guido Haschke.</p>
<p>However, the Milan Appellate court’s judgement of April 7 — which convicted the former CEOs of Finmecannica and AgustaWestland for corruption and fraud — reproduces, on page 187, a joint affidavit on stamp paper ostensibly written by both Haschke and Christian Michel.</p>

<p>This document has been corrected by hand and bears the writing of Christian Michel.</p>
<p>Although the Enforcement Directorate (ED) may have now moved in on Christian Michel, the mysterious third middleman in the AgustaWestland helicopter case continues to remain a major figure. Italian authorities were eager to hear him but were unable to arrest him since he fled to Dubai.</p>
<p>Michel claimed in his interview that he had nothing whatsoever to do with the VVIP scam in India although he had several other contracts with AgustaWestland in the past.</p>
<p>It emerges from the court document that there was a falling out between Haschke and Michel with the former clearly feeling hard done by.</p>
<p>The document reproduced by the Milan Appellate Court indicates that there was some disagreement between Haschke and Michel about the exact amount of commission that would be paid. The affidavit claims that the “family” (read the Tyagi brothers including “cousin” S.P.Tyagi) had been promised 28 million Euros.</p>
<p>It also says the two parties, Haschke and Michel agreed to honour that amount. It emerges that two separate agreements were signed by AgustaWestland, the first for 42 million Euros with Michel’s company Global Services FZE (struck off and replaced by “the team”) and the second, for 28 million Euros with “the family” or “not less than 5 per cent of the total value of the contract”.</p>
<p>The family insisted its share of the spoils had “to be honoured”. So Guido Haschke and Christian Michel decided to reduce their commission from 42 million Euros to 30 million Euros.</p>
<p>The changes in the affidavit, written partly across the revenue stamps at the bottom are in the handwriting of Christian Michel, Haschke claims in his</p>
<p>deposition before the court. “The team has agreed to accept 30 million instead of 42!” writes Christian Michel. “And the team wants the other agreement of 28 million with the family to be honoured completely in full.”</p>
<p>Both men have placed their initials at the bottom of the affidavit, Haschke on the left, Michel on the right.</p>
<p>In his deposition to the court Haschke says: “The final document, after discussions with Michel, was, in my view completely insufficient. I would refuse to put my name to it.” That was, he explained to the Prosecutor, because both he and Michel had been promised an equal share and he felt he was being double crossed by the Briton.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eleven inmates, including at least seven children, of a government-run mental health and rehabilitation institute on the outskirts of the state capital have died of septicimea and food poisoning while the condition of three others — admitted to the JK Lon government children’s hospital — has worsened over the last 12 days.</p>
<p>The issue came to light with the death of two children on Thursday. “Fifteen children, were admitted to the hospital on April 21. Seven of them have passed away while three others are critical. Four have been discharged,” JK Lon Hospital superintendent Dr Ashok Gupta told <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>.</p>
<p>The children were aged between 6 to 15 years, Dr Gupta said. “They suffered from some bacterial disease caused due to ingesting impure water or food. When they were brought in, they exhibited septic shock and septicimea. One of them showed symptoms of cholera,” he added.</p>

<p>Besides the 15 children, at least four adults were admitted to the Sawai Man Singh Government Hospital nearby. Earlier, as many as 10 other inmates of the institute at Jamdoli were also admitted to the two hospitals.</p>
<p>“The condition of the inmates suddenly deteriorated. So we got them admitted on April 16. Two days later, one of the children died. Since then, the deaths have continued,” superintendent of the facility Anita Chaudhary said. “We don’t know what happened to them,” she said.</p>
<p>Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment Arun Chaturvedi had earlier reportedly blamed the children’s poor immunity as a reason behind the deaths. Chaturvedi visited the children at the hospital on Friday.</p>
<p>“Prima facie, it seems to be some sort of infection that spread, since the deaths occurred on different dates. We have set up a two member probe committee to find out what went wrong. Action will be taken against anyone who is found responsible,” Chaturvedi told the media.</p>
<p>State <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> president Sachin Pilot, who visited the hospital as well, accused the state government of callousness. “The chief minister should take active interest in the probe. The incident and the government’s reaction reflects callousness. If their immunity was weak, they should have been provided even better care. This is criminal neglect that resulted in the death of these children. Whoever is responsible should be booked for causing death by negligence,” Pilot told The Indian Express.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777224&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2775607" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/pargat-singh1.jpg" alt="Pargat Singh" /> Pargat Singh
<p>Having played as a defender for a large part of his life as a professional hockey player, Pargat Singh, the former India hockey captain, has now gone on the offensive in his last year as an MLA from Jalandhar Cantonment. In keeping with his role as a master of modern ‘total hockey’ in India, Pargat is now scoring for his constituents &#8211; and ‘against’ his party, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), as some would see it.</p>
<p>His move to turn down the government’s offer to make him the Chief Parliamentary Secretary (CPS) in Punjab earlier this week forced Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal to shelve the state’s much-touted solid waste management project in Jalandhar. Pargat has been opposed to the project, which was to be located in Jamsher village in his constituency, from the moment it was proposed.</p>
<p>The decision to shelve the project was seen as a desperate means to placate Pargat. But it did not help &#8211; he did not accept the post even then. Both sides say there are no differences besides, and beyond, the waste management project &#8211; which the government sees as essential for Jalandhar to grow as a city, and one that the MLA sees as a health hazard for the locality.</p>

<p>“There are no differences&#8230;Chief Minister [Badal] had yesterday made it clear there was no plan to set up the solid waste management plant [at the proposed site],” SAD spokesperson and Punjab Education Minister Daljit Singh Cheema said. “Local people are always opposed to such plants, but now there is advanced technology where comparatively lesser area is required to set up the plant.”</p>
<p>Pargat would have none of that contention. For him, this ‘revolt’ was neither a sudden decision nor, he says, did it have any political motivation. “Officials have no idea about the ground reality&#8230;they make plans sitting in air-conditioned offices in Jalandhar and Chandigarh,” he said. “I will not allow this project at the proposed site. Such plants must be installed at a distance of (at least) 500 meters from [inhabited] area. But the demarcated site of this plant is between the Jamsher dairy complex, where there are 16,000 cattle; and 7,000 people live on the doorstep of this plant.</p>
<p>“Besides, 850 quintal milk is supplied from there to Jalandhar city every day.”The government, he said, is yet to set up a biogas plant, as it had promised, to manage the huge amounts of cow dung generated in the area. “There is a sewer water treatment plant, and now this plant (if it comes up) will make life hell for people&#8230;hundreds of trucks would come and dump garbage in this village every day.”</p>
<p>As for the decision to not take up the prestigious CPS post, Pargat indicated that if the government did not think it fit to make him CPS (Sports) in these four years, there’s little to be achieved in the few months before the elections next year. “Although sports is my area of interest and expertise, I could not do much in this direction in the last more than four years since being elected as MLA. I ended up only being an adviser,” Pargat told <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>.</p>
<p>He said had he got responsibility when the government was formed, he would have “certainly done something positive” in sports for the state. But now, with elections round the corner, the post of CPS would not only be a drain on the state exchequer but also will not give him any time to work on the details. But despite this rebellion, Pargat assured that he will “still be with SAD”.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777213&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Express Photo: Abhijit Alka Anil)
<p>The Bombay High Court on Friday ordered the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to demolish the 31-storey Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society in South Mumbai.</p>
<p>The High Court also directed the Centre and state government to consider launching criminal proceedings against bureaucrats, politicians and ministers for “committing various offences in acquiring the plots” on which the society was constructed and for abuse of power.</p>

<p>“Union of India and state government should consider initiating appropriate civil and criminal proceedings against the concerned bureaucrats, politicians and ministers if not already done,” said a division bench.</p>
<p>On a plea by the Adarsh Housing Society, the bench stayed its order for 12 weeks to enable an appeal to be filed before the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The order was delivered by a bench of Justices R V More and R G Ketkar on a bunch of petitions filed by Adarsh Society challenging the demolition order of the MoEF and a suit filed by the Ministry of Defence, claiming that it owned the land on which the society was built.</p>
<p>The Society has been mired in controversy after reports first emerged in 2010 that politicians, bureaucrats and ministers had promoted the society that had been originally earmarked as a housing project for Kargil war widows.</p>
<p>The then Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan had to subsequently quit after reports emerged that some of his family members had been alloted flats in the society.</p>

<p>A two-member Commission appointed by the state government submitted a report in April 2013 which said the land belonged to the government of Maharashtra and not to the Ministry of Defence. It also stated that the land in question or membership of the Adarsh CHS was not reserved for Defence Personnel or Kargil war heroes.</p>
<p>“Union of India and state government should consider initiating departmental proceedings against bureaucrats in accordance with law. The disciplinary authority shall take the decision in accordance with law and without being influenced by observations and findings recorded,” said the bench, adding that the Society will also bear the cost of demolition.</p>

<p>The Adarsh CHS has been told to pay Rs 1 lakh each to six persons, including Bharat Bhushan, the then MoEF director; Nalini Bhat, former advisor and competent authority, MoEF; E Thirunavukkarasu, then deputy director MoEF; and Dr A Senthil, an official in MoEF, apart from Sitaram Kunte, former commissioner of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and T C Benjamin, then an Urban Development Department official.</p>

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
<p>The court order comes after MoEF decided to get the scam-tainted CHS demolished in 2011.The ministry had said that the construction was illegal as it had been carried out without obtaining necessary clearances in the Coastal Regulation Zone area. The CHS had denied the charges and claimed that it had all the clearances.</p>
<p>Another plea filed by Adarsh CHS dealt with cancellation of the occupancy certificate and cutting of water and power supply by authorities.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2776259&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Stating that “facts and circumstances” brought on record prima facie “establishes the hatching of a criminal conspiracy after careful calculation and minute planning”, a Delhi special court Friday ordered former Minister of State for Coal Dasari Narayan Rao, former <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> MP and industrialist Naveen Jindal, former Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda and 12 others to be put on trial. They face charges of criminal breach of trust and criminal conspiracy in a 2008 allocation of a coal block in Jharkhand.</p>
<p>Special Judge Bharat Parashar, ordering framing of charges over alleged irregularities in the allocation of the Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block, said prima facie it “appears that facade of various companies has been created as a smokescreen to cover up the actual payoff” of Rs 2 crore to Rao by Jindal through his “group of companies or associated companies” to secure a coal block for his firms Jindal Steel Power Limited (JSPL) and Gagan Sponge Iron Pvt Ltd (GSIPL).</p>
<p>Apart from Rao, Jindal and Koda, the other accused are former Coal Secretary H C Gupta; Rajeev Jain, Director of Jindal Realty Pvt Ltd; Girish Kumar Suneja and Radha Krishna Saraf, Directors of GSIPL; Suresh Singhal, Director of New Delhi Exim Pvt Ltd (NDEPL); K Ramakrishna Prasad, Managing Director of Sowbhagya Media Ltd; and chartered accountant Gyan Swaroop Garg.</p>

<p>Five firms — JSPL, Jindal Realty Pvt Ltd, Gagan Infraenergy Ltd (formerly known as GSIPL), Sowbhagya Media Ltd and NDEPL — have also been ordered to be put on trial. The court said charges are to be framed against all accused under IPC sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) read with 409 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) and under sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The court will formally put all accused on trial on May 11.</p>
<p>The court agreed to hear the plea of accused Suresh Singhal to turn approver in the case. The court will hear his plea on May 11.</p>
<p>“&#8230;if the entire process of allocation of coal block&#8230; is seen and analysed while also keeping in mind the money trail whereby Rs 2 crore came to be transferred to Dasari Narayan Rao by Naveen Jindal, the same, prima facie, reflects active collusion between public servants involved in the process and private parties in whose favour the coal block stood allotted,” Parashar said.</p>
<p>The special court said Jindal prima facie was the “central figure” in the entire conspiracy. “In fact, his role has come out to be that of a central figure around whom the entire criminal conspiracy revolved&#8230; as being the common central thread running through all the said transactions through his various group or associated companies&#8230; his role even travels beyond the area of grave suspicion as regard his complicity,” Parashar said.</p>
<p>The court said GSIPL prima facie could “not have been allocated any coal block at all in any circumstance” and “not only it was found to be ineligible” but it had “grossly misrepresented on many aspects both at the time of submission of its application form and also in the feedback form”.</p>
<p>“The facts collected during investigation also show that there was rather no intention on the part of GSIPL to establish any power plant and thereby to use the coal to be extracted from the said coal block,” Parashar said.</p>
<p>The court said it is an “admitted fact” that NDEPL invested a sum of Rs 2 crore in Sowbhagya Media Ltd (SML) and the investment “in fact constitutes one part of the entire money trail.” It said the second part of the alleged money trail “demonstrates” how Rs 2 crore invested by NDEPL was “actually money belonging” to Naveen Jindal Group of Companies. It also said “grave suspicion arises” as regard the “genuineness” of transactions in which NDEPL invested Rs 2 crore in SML.</p>
<p>“Naveen Jindal Group of Companies were primarily owned by Naveen Jindal and he was the central figure through whom the said payoff of Rs 2 crores flowed. In fact, a web of various corporate entities has been introduced to cover-up the said illegal act of making a payment of Rs 2 crore to Dasari Narayan Rao,” Parashar said.</p>
<p>On Madhu Koda, the special court said it was prima facie “clear” that being the then Chief Minister, he “ensured” that the recommendation for the entire coal block be made to the Ministry of Coal “only” in favour of Naveen Jindal Group of Companies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8Y52LVsNB&amp;v=hm2N0gk7_ig"><strong>WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE</strong></a></p>
[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
<p>On Dasari Narayan Rao, the court said, it was prima facie clear that he was in “active agreement and connivance” with Jindal and his group of companies. “Prima facie it is clear that Rao abused his official position in pursuance to the conspiracy so hatched with the other co-accused persons so as to facilitate allotment of Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block in favour of JSPL and GSIPL,” the court said.</p>
<p>The court said prima facie all transactions seem to have been undertaken with the “assistance of best of the legal brains and experts in financial transactions” to “escape the clutches of law and to give each of the transactions a semblance of compliance with law.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;H C Gupta, Secretary Coal and Chairman Screening Committee, along with Dasari Narayan Rao, Minister of State for Coal, consciously chose to overlook all such misrepresentations or false and highly inflated unsubstantiated claims of the company even though they were writ large on the face of record,” the court said.</p>
<p>Reacting to the court order, a spokesperson for JSPL said: “In the context of the Special Court’s order in respect of allocation of the Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block and the charges thereof, JSPL reiterates that it is confident that it will stand vindicated at the end of the ongoing judicial process. We deny all allegations made against our company and its management. We have full faith in the Indian judicial system and are confident to come out clean during the process. The said allocation was made to the company purely on merit and, all along the course of the investigation, the company and its officials have fully cooperated with the authorities, and whenever asked, explained and provided all supporting documents.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2775861&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2776866 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/agustawestland1.jpg" alt="agustawestland deal, narendra modi agustawestland, agustawestland modi, " /> New Delhi: All India Women <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> members staging protest against <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> government over AgustaWestland chopper scam, at BJP head-office in New Delhi on Friday. (Source: PTI)
<p>RESPONDING to allegations levelled by the main Opposition Congress on its probe in the AgustaWestland helicopter deal, the government Friday denied that Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> had “cut any deal” with Italy on this issue and described such charges as an attempt to divert attention from the “central issue” of corruption.</p>
<p>In a press release, the government also denied any links between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister Nripendra Mishra to “one of the accused” in the helicopter deal.</p>
<p>“In the matter pertaining to acquisition of AgustaWestland helicopters, the undisputed central issue that stands out is corruption, especially bribery. Any other line of assumption, approach and effort, as is being attempted in some quarters, is misleading, tries to hide the wrong-doers and is driven by instincts of self preservation,” said the release.</p>

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEYBjqe0fs4&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
<p>The press release did not specify whose allegations it was responding to but on Wednesday, the official website of the Congress had posted a detailed criticism of the government’s probe in the deal, including a set of 10 questions. One of them was: “Did Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ever offer to cut a deal in Italian Marines case with a view to perpetuate a conspiracy against Congress leadership?”</p>

<p>The government stated: “Those who cannot see Prime Minister succeed even hint at him cutting a deal. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Prime Minister Modi did not cut any deal of any sort. His only goal and priority is the development of comprehensive national power, and empowerment of our masses.”</p>
<p>The Congress had also sought to link former Air Chief Marshal S P Tyagi, who has been accused by an Italian court of having met several AW officials along with his cousins, with the Vivekananda International Foundation with which Doval and Mishra were associated.</p>
<p>The government stated: “A few have even sought to link one of the accused with Ajit Doval, present NSA, as also Nripendra Mishra, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister. This is a totally baseless assertion, devoid of reason and logic, and indicative of malicious intent. In reality, there is no such connection.”</p>
<p>The statement said: “It is indeed tragic that a small section of the Indian polity has attempted, unsuccessfully, to divert and diffuse the public discourse on this matter. They question the speed of the government processes, especially the investigation. But, they do not ask how the corrupt influenced the process of acquisition in the first place and bled the nation. They do not admit corruption; they instead boldly proclaim, “catch us if you can”.”</p>
<p>The government added that its investigative agencies “remain determined to bring to justice the key perpetrators of this misdeed, both inside and outside the country”.</p>
<p>On Opposition allegations about AW helicopters purchased by the BJP-ruled governments of Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the statement said the Centre has been proactive in seeking response and that the charges were addressed at the state level.</p>
<p>“The government appeals to the countrymen to recognise the nature and depth of corruption in AgustaWestland case. The investigative agencies will stay their course in unveiling the corrupt and holding them accountable to our public,” it said.</p>
<p>”On the core issue of corruption, the timeline of actions taken by the CBI and Enforcement Directorate clearly shows due rigour and diligence with which these agencies have pursued all aspects of their investigations, including the arrest and extradition of three foreign nationals namely Carlo Gerosa, Guido Haschke Ralph and Christian Michel James,” it said. All were listed as middlemen in the deal by Italian prosecutors.</p>
<p>”The government has acted proactively and with alacrity against Agusta Westland International and Finmeccanica. It is the present government which through its order dated 3 July 2014, put on hold all procurement/acquisition cases in the pipeline of six companies figuring in the FIR registered by the CBI, namely: M/S Agusta Westland International Ltd., UK, M/S Finmeccanica, Italy, and its group companies, including subsidiaries and affiliates, M/S IDS, Tunisia, M/S Infotech Design System (IDS), Mauritius, M/S IDS Infotech Ltd, Mohali and M/S Aeromatrix Info Solution Pvt Ltd, Chandigarh.”</p>
<p>It added: “In doing so, we did not let the preparedness of our defence forces suffer. At the same time, we also ensured that no new capital procurement was made thereafter from these companies in the tenure of the present government.”</p>
<p>It stated: “The factually misinformed have also made a mention regarding clearance of a joint venture involving Agusta Westland by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. This proposal was approved on 2nd September 2011 based on an application by Indian Rotorcraft Ltd a joint venture of Tata Sons with Agusta Westland NV, Netherlands. This was later changed to Agusta Westland S.p.A Italy due to reorganization within the group. On 7th February 2012, an industrial licence for the manufacture of helicopters was granted by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion to Indian Rotorcraft Ltd. However, the validity of licence has since expired.”</p>
<p>Incidentally, <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> had reported on Friday that AgustaWestland had obtained approval to start a facility called Indian Rotorcraft Ltd (IRL) for assembly of AW-199Kx helicopters in Hyderabad Aviation SEZ in a joint venture with Tata Aerospace.</p>
<p>IRL had confirmed in writing to The Indian Express that its “original plan was to assemble the AW119Ke helicopters. However, the model subsequently got upgraded to the AW119Kx helicopters. Regulations required that this change in model also be approved by the FIPB, which the FIPB did on September 2013. In October 2015, IRL also received FIPB’s approval for an assembly unit.”</p>
<p>The Joint Venture had also stated that “industrial licence which was issued in 2012 for 2 years has expired and the company has already reapplied for it. IRL will export the assembled helicopters to AW for it to sell to its customers.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2776755 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/modi-kejriwa-759.jpg" alt="CIC, Pm modi, Narendra Modi, Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi CM, Delhi Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Gujrat university, Delhi university, Central Information Commission, degress of Modi and Kejriwal, Modi's educational qualificaton, Kejriwal's educational qualification, india news" /> Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> (Left) and Delhi CM <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/arvind-kejriwal/">Arvind Kejriwal</a>.
<p>The Central Information Commission (CIC) Friday directed Delhi University and Gujarat University to search and provide information on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s degrees to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.</p>
<p>The order comes a day after Kejriwal criticised the CIC saying while it wanted him to provide information regarding his electoral photo identity card, it was “obstructing information” about Modi’s degrees.</p>
<p>Taking the unusual step of considering Kejriwal’s response as an “application under RTI in his capacity as a citizen”, Information Commissioner M Sridhar Acharyulu also directed the Prime Minister’s Office to provide “specific number and year” of Modi’s degree and PG degree to Delhi University and Gujarat University “so that it will be easy for them to search and provide any documents relating to it”.</p>
<p>Reached for comment after the order, Acharyulu said: “I cannot comment anything about my order.”</p>
<p>In a tweet, Kejriwal said, “We welcome CIC decision. All speculations wud be put to rest now.”</p>

<p>In the order, while underlining that “not prescribing the educational (degree based) qualification for contesting electoral offices is one of the great features of Indian democracy” and “what is needed is education not degrees”, Acharyulu said “when a citizen holding the position of Chief Ministership wants to know the degree related information of the Prime Minister, it will be proper to disclose”.</p>
<p>“The Commission directs the PIOs of Delhi University and Gujarat University, Ahmedabad, to make best possible search for information regarding degrees in the name of “Mr Narendra Damodar Modi” in the year 1978 (Graduation in DU) and 1983 (Post Graduation in GU) and provide it to the appellant Mr Kejriwal as soon as possible,” he said, adding that “the time limit is not prescribed keeping in view the difficulty in searching without specific number”.</p>
<p>Acharyulu said “educational qualification related information about public authority or public servant or political leader occupying constitutional position is not hit by any exception under Section 8 of the RTI Act. It cannot be stated as personal or private information also. In fact, the information about educational degrees of Prime Minister is already in public domain”.</p>
<p>He recalled that “in an interview to a senior journalist, Mr Rajiv Shukla, Mr Narendra Modi explained that he completed High School and on the advice of an elderly personality, he obtained degree and PG through external examinations without stepping into the colleges”.</p>
<p>“This generated a lot of curiosity among the people, who expressed their feelings in various social media and newspaper websites in the form of comments. The curiosity cannot be equated with public interest. Just because the public is interested in it, it does not mean that it is in public interest. There is no educational qualification prescribed for contesting any electoral position under law. The election to <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/">Lok Sabha</a> or Prime Ministership cannot be questioned on the point of educational qualification. Where there is a prescribed educational qualification for a position, and its existence was doubted, its disclosure will be in public interest,” the Information Commissioner said.</p>
<p>The order comes in the wake of a CIC order and Kejriwal’s “written submission” where he stated that while he was ready to share information sought by an RTI applicant, the CIC must also order disclosure of education qualifications of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>In the case of Hans Raj Jain, who had sought details of students who graduated in 1978 with names starting with letters N (Narendra) and M (Modi), the CPIO of Delhi University said “it will be very difficult to search with the starting letters of the names&#8230; even with the full name Narendra, it may not be possible to secure the details especially when there is no mention of specific roll number along with the year number in the degree was allotted”.</p>
<p>The response of the CPIO was upheld by the First Appellate Authority. Thereafter, Jain again approached the CIC in November 2015. In its order dated April 11, 2016, Acharyulu closed the matter saying “it is too difficult to search such names if roll number is not provided as data is maintained roll number-wise”.</p>

<p>DELHI UNIVERSITY (DU) on Friday halted “sale and distribution” of the Hindi version of a book authored by historian, the late Bipan Chandra, a day after Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman P J Kurien told the government to remove all references in it to Bhagat Singh being a “revolutionary terrorist”.</p>
<p>“The sale and distribution of the book Bharat ka Swatantra Sangharsh, which is a Hindi translation of the book titled India’s Struggle for Independence authored by Bipan Chandra, Mridula Mukherjee, Aditya Mukherjee, Sucheta Mahajan and K N Panikkar, first published in 1988&#8230; have been stopped,” said DU Media Coordinator Malay Neerav.</p>
<p>“The Hindi version&#8230; was published in 1990 by the Directorate of Hindi Medium Implementation (DHMI) of the University of Delhi,” said Neerav. India’s Struggle for Independence is on the reading list of DU’s history department.</p>

<p>DU Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi clarified that “only the sale and distribution” of the book had been stopped, and that the move had “nothing to do with introducing changes in the curriculum of the history department”.</p>
<p>“Due to objectionable terms being used for Bhagat Singh in the book, which was brought to our notice by his relatives and others, along with the fact that the authors themselves said they did not want this version to continue, we decided to stop the sale and distribution,” Tyagi told <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>.</p>
<p>“This has nothing to do with the curriculum or reading list prepared by the history department, which is its prerogative. The university administration, registrar or the vice-chancellor cannot intervene in that,” said Tyagi.</p>
<p>The DU move, however, was criticised by its teachers’ association. “Preferably, the decision should have been taken after taking suggestions from an expert committee. If there is any further plan of altering the reading list, the matter should go to the Academic Council (AC),” said Nandita Narain, president, DU Teachers’ Association (DUTA).</p>
<p>Responding to the DU decision, the book’s co-author Aditya Mukherjee said, “I am surprised that the university had taken such a decision despite us having written to the V-C that we ourselves wanted the term “revolutionary terrorist” to de dropped. We expressed the same to the Dean of DHMI, and she said she would be happy to make the changes.”</p>
<p>In a letter to V-C Tyagi written on Thursday, Mukherjee had said, “Bipan Chandra himself had stopped using this description in his later writings and had publicly stated that he would not like the word ‘terrorist’ to be used any longer. On behalf of the co-authors Mridula Mukherjee, K N Panikkar and Sucheta Mahajan and myself, I want to convey to you our intention to make the necessary changes in the book.with immediate effect.”</p>
<p>Historian D N Jha, who was the head of DU’s history department in 1988 when the book was first introduced on the reading list, said it was of “seminal importance”. “When the book was written, the use of the word “terrorist” meant somebody different from a “moderate”; someone who did not believe in ahimsa (non-violence). Later Bipan had started using the term ‘revolutionary socialist’,” he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Yadvinder Sandhu, Bhagat Singh’s great grand-nephew, along with Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activists met the DU administration and demanded that the book be banned and removed from the curriculum.</p>
<p>”We welcome the DU move but it should have come earlier. Penguin should follow suit and stop the sale and distribution of the English version too. Also, every such book which suffers from a colonial baggage and uses pejorative terms for our freedom fighters should be done away with. Indian history needs to be decolonised and Indianised,” said Saket Bahuguna, national media convenor, ABVP.</p>

<p>Following Kurien’s intervention on Thursday, MoS for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had assured that the government will ask the minister concerned — HRD <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/smriti-irani/">Smriti Irani</a> — to take “necessary steps”.</p>
<p>In Chapter 20, the book describes Bhagat Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Surya Sen and others as “revolutionary terrorists”. It also describes the Chittagong movement as a “terrorist act” and the killing of British police officer John Sanders as an “act of terrorism”.</p>
<p>Kurien’s statement and Naqvi’s assurance came in response to JD(U) leader K C Tyagi raising the issue in the Upper House during ‘Zero Hour’.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777209&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2593152 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2015/12/anandiben-759.jpg" alt="gujarat, gujarat reservation, gujarat quota, reservations, economic reservations, gujarat economic reservations, gujarat news, india news" /> Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel told the media that the reservation will be given to all those whose annual income is Rs.6 lakh or less
<p>The Gujarat government Friday announced it will bring an ordinance to provide 10 per cent reservation for economically backward classes (EBC) among upper castes on May 1, the state’s Foundation Day. Families that earn less than Rs 6 lakh per year will qualify for the quota.</p>
<p>Senior Gujarat cabinet minister and the state’s <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> chief Vijay Rupani made the announcement at the party headquarters after a core committee meeting, attended by BJP chief Amit Shah, Chief Minister Anandiben Patel and senior ministers from the state.</p>
<p>Rupani said the state government is ready to fight a legal battle since the decision breaches the reservation limit of 50 per cent set by the Supreme Court. The state government already provides 49 per cent quota to SC/STs and OBCs.</p>
<p>Rupani said the newly announced quota would be exclusively for EBCs from upper castes, and would not affect reservation already available for SC/STs and OBCs.</p>

<p>The announcement comes against the backdrop of the Patidar reservation stir, which started after the community demanded inclusion in the list of OBC communities. The BJP had faced major setbacks in taluka and district panchayat elections held recently as a fallout of the agitation by the agrarian Patidar community, considered the backbone of BJP’s vote bank. The CM had taken a firm stand against the Patidar demand, saying it was not possible to include them in the OBC list.</p>
<p>Asked if the announcement was a result of the Patidar quota stir, Rupani said, “The decision was made after taking into consideration various discussions on the reservation agitation and sentiments of people.” He said the party high-command, including Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a>, had given a green signal to the move.</p>
<p>Asked about the fate of Hardik Patel, the Patidar leader who is behind bars under <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/what-is-section-124-a-under-which-one-is-charged-with-sedition/">sedition</a> charges, Rupani said, “Today’s meeting was only for this (EBC reservation).”</p>
<p>For the last few weeks, a high-level committee of senior ministers of the Gujarat government had been negotiating in vain with Patidar representatives to bring an end to the agitation.</p>
<p>The two major Patidar groups — Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) and Sardar Patel Group (SPG) — were quick to respond to the announcement.</p>
<p>“This is just another lollipop given by the state government to mislead the Patel community. We do not accept this reservation for EBCs. Our main demand is to release Hardik from jail. We want reservation as a Special Backward Class, as has been announced in Rajasthan,” PAAS spokesperson Dharmik Malaviya told <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>. PAAS is led by 22-year-old Hardik.</p>
<p>SPG chief Lalji Patel said, “We will study the 10 per cent provisions to see if what Patidars will get is in proportion to what the community has lost. Only then we will make a statement on it&#8230; But I welcome the fact that the government has started to give reservation.”</p>
<p>In Gujarat, OBCs get 27 per cent reservation, SCs get 7 per cent and STs get 15 per cent. This means the latest reservation announcement is in direct conflict with the 50 per cent cap on quota set by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“We are very serious about this and we will fight it up to the apex court for reservation of economically backward among the general category,” Rupani said.</p>

<p>In the budget session of the Gujarat assembly that concluded on March 31, the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> had submitted a private member’s bill to introduce 20 per cent reservation for EBCs. Though the bill did not come for discussion in the assembly, the Gujarat government’s announcement comes less than a month after that. Rupani, however, said, “The Congress is just indulging in tall assertions. We are making a concrete announcement. I challenge the Congress to formulate such schemes for upper castes in states where they are in power.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2775857&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The firing incident in which Shiv Sena district president Deepak Kamboj was injured in the leg was a “drama” staged by the victim, police alleged Friday.</p>
<p>Kamboj, who is son of Shiv Sena North president Vinay Jalandhari, was attacked by two bike-borne accused on February 16 near Shiv Jyoti Park where he was going to fetch his children from school.</p>
<p>The two accused in the case have been arrested. Police said they were Kamboj’s friends and were the ones who fired at him.</p>
<p>Kamboj, too, has been booked for criminal conspiracy. He is alleged to have helped the two accused with the licence for the firearm which was used in the firing. He is also alleged to have helped the two get a second licence after the incident.</p>
<p>The police said the shootout was staged to enable Kamboj claim more security and an escort vehicle.</p>
<p>Despite repeated efforts by <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> to contact Kamboj for comments, he remained unavailable. His father too was not available.</p>
<p>The development came three days after the appointment of ADGP, Internal Vigilance, Prabodh Kumar to investigate the six attacks on the Shiv Sena leaders in the recent past in Punjab.</p>
<p>Earlier, failing to obtain any clues in the case, police had announced a Rs 5 lakh award to anyone offering information about the incident.</p>
<p>Jalandhar police commissioner Arpit Shukla said the two accused, Gaurav Sondhi and Supinder Singh Shampy, have been arrested.</p>
<p>Shukla said they had admitted that the firing drama was enacted by the victim himself to get more security as well as an escort vehicle ahead of elections. They also informed that Kamboj had promised them weapon licences.</p>

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
<p>“He had asked his friends to fire in such a manner so that there would not be much injury but he received serious injury in his leg and needed to be hospitalised,” said the police commissioner, adding that Deepak kept his promise and got issued weapon license to them in lieu of this task.</p>
<p>He helped them get one weapon licence before the attack for the firearm used to fire at him. The second licence was issued after the attack. Deepak Jalandhari also took Rs 80,000 from them to get them the licences, said Commissioner.</p>
<p>While Garuav is in a printing press business, Shampy is a property dealer. Police booked Deepak under 120 (B).</p>
<p>Police said an informant had been given Rs 5 lakh for providing information about the accused.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777195&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE SECOND additional district and sessions court in Mangaluru on Friday rejected an anticipatory bail plea filed by the founder of the NaMo Brigade, Naresh Shenoy, in connection with the March 21 murder of RTI activist Vinayak Baliga.</p>
<p>The court while rejecting the anticipatory bail plea noted that the murder of the RTI activist was a clear case of contract killing and that the role of Shenoy, 39, had emerged during police investigations and statements collected by investigators.</p>
<p>The court upheld the argument of the public prosecutor that witnesses might be threatened if Shenoy is granted anticipatory bail.</p>

<p>Shenoy, absconding since March 25, had filed the bail plea fearing arrest after he emerged as a prime suspect in the murder of the Baliga, 51. The murder was allegedly carried out by two contract killers, Nishith Devadiga and Vinith Poojary, who were arrested a week after the murder by Mangaluru police.</p>
<p>Police investigations in the case revealed that several persons linked to Shenoy were involved in the awarding of the contract for the killing.</p>
<p>During the hearing of Shenoy’s anticipatory bail plea, the police told the district court that the phone call details of Shenoy and other suspects, the voluntary statements provided by three persons arrested so far and the presence of a car linked to Shenoy at the scene of the March 21 murder all disclosed the involvement of the NaMo Brigade founder in the murder.</p>
<p>The elderly parents of the murdered RTI activist sought denial of bail on the grounds that the accused would influence witnesses and would derail prosecution.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777214&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A DAY before he would have ceased to be minister in the state cabinet, Prisons Minister Balwant Singh Ramoowalia was Friday nominated to the legislative council on the recommendation of CM Akhilesh Yadav.</p>
<p>Governor Ram Naik cleared his name, along with two others — Zaheer Hassan ‘Waseem Barelvi’ and Madhukar Jetley — moments after he received the CM’s list of new recommended names to fill up four of the six vacant posts in the council.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MOHAMMAD SADIQUE is a Sikh although his parents and wife were Muslim. For, not changing the name would not make him a Muslim when he embraced Sikhism.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court held this on Friday as it reinstated Sadique as MLA from Punjab’s Bhadaur constituency. Sadique, a <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> leader, was elected from Bhadur (Sangrur), a seat reserved for Scheduled Castes, in the 2012 assembly polls.</p>
<p>Sadique’s election had been set aside by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in April 2015 after it was challenged by SAD-<a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> candidate Darbara Singh Guru. Guru, a former IAS officer, had contended that Sadiqu contested from an SC seat despite being a Muslim.</p>

<p>The High Court accepted his petition and said that Sadique had failed to prove his conversion from Islam to Sikhism. “Since he is a Muslim, he is not qualified to contest the election on a seat reserved for the Scheduled Castes,” it had said while disqualifying Sadique as an MLA.</p>
<p>But the apex court overturned this judgment after laying down important legal principles regarding religious conversion. A bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and P C Pant ruled that “it is not essential for anyone to change one’s name after embracing a different faith”.</p>
<p>The court said it was not necessary in law that entire family of a person should convert or reconvert to the religion to which he has gone. Referring to a body of judgments, the bench held that loss of caste is not irrevocable and the caste can be revived if the two religions permit its retention.</p>
<p>It also lent credence to Sadique’s statement that although his parents and wife were Muslim, he always followed Sikh traditions and that he never offered namaz nor observed roza nor went to Haj.</p>
<p>Further, Sadique got his daughters married in Hindu families and was accepted by the Sikh community, which was apparent from his visits to gurdwaras where he performed kirtans and other ceremonies and rituals. The court noted that he and his children were duly issued Schedule Caste certificates since Sadique was born in ‘doom’ caste in Punjab.</p>
<p>Sadique could also adequately explain that since he was popular as a singer with the name ‘Mohammad Sadique’ as such without changing his name, he accepted Sikhism and followed all rites and traditions of Sikh religion.</p>
<p>The bench therefore upheld Sadique’s election as the MLA from Bhadur and rejected the election petition by his opponent SAD-BJP leader.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777180&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Friday expelled Rampal Yadav, party MLA from Biswan in Sitapur district, on charges of indiscipline, illegal activities, irregularities and maligning the image of Samajwadi Party.</p>
<p>This comes on a day when Yadav and eight of his associates were sent to jail by a local court after he was arrested on Thursday for allegedly assaulting Lucknow Development Authority officials, who were bulldozing his “illegal” under-construction commercial complex in Jiamau area. Yadav was produced before the court of an additional chief judicial magistrate, who rejected his bail plea and sent him to judicial custody for 14 days.</p>

<p>Opposing in-charge Gujarat DGP P P Pandey’s application for permission from a special CBI court to go abroad for two months, the probe agency on Friday said if his plea was allowed, it would “delay the trial” in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case. Pandey, chargesheeted in the encounter case, is currently on bail.</p>
<p>In a five-page reply filed before special judge S J Raje, Inspector Vishwas Kumar Meena stated, “Allowing the applicant to remain away for such a long period may delay the trial which would also hamper the case of the prosecution.”</p>
<p>The CBI said, “The presence of accused applicant is required before this court during the framing of charge. Further, the applicant has not furnished the contact address and contact numbers of abroad, and the place/address where he would stay during the said period, the travel itinerary etc.”</p>

<p>During the brief hearing, when the court observed that since filing of the application circumstances seems to have changed, the IPS official’s Lawyer Paresh Nayak said, “Pandey is now the in-charge DGP of Gujarat.” When Pandey moved the plea last month, he was posted as Director, Anti-Corruption Bureau.</p>
<p>The court has reserved its order for Monday.</p>
<p>Pandey has sought to modify his bail condition which barred him from leaving India. In his application, Pandey sought relief on the ground that he wants to visit his son and his family, who are residents of the UK.</p>
<p>The other ground for traveling abroad mentioned by Pandey was for completion of his doctoral research. He is pursuing PhD from MS University, Vadodara, since 2009 on “The Changing Role and Dynamics of United Nations Peace Keeping Operations after Cold War.”</p>
<p>For this purpose, Pandey wants to “do some survey and research work and meet the head of Institute of Peace Research in Canada, and also the UN headquarters in New York and collect some information and guidance for the PhD for which he wants visas for UK, USA, France and Canada for two months from May 20 to June 20”.</p>
<p>Apart from Pandey, co-accused GL Singhal has sought temporary modification of bail for a month to visit “different universities in the USA for further studies of his daughter”.</p>

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
<p>The CBI reply on Singhal’s plea is identical where the agency said that “considering the gravity of offence, the application of the present applicant accused to allow him to visit the US from 12th May 2016 to 15th June 2016, deserves to be rejected outrightly”.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777183&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Bose noted that the two “actually left their homes on their way to India but the government of Pakistan at the last moment raised objections to their leaving the country.”</p>
<p>Bose wrote that Shah was a “close associate of Netaji”, and Malik was “the first man to hoist the national tricolour on Indian soil in 1941.”</p>
<p>Emphasising that their presence would help the seminar, Bose sought “advice and guidance” of Vajpayee for “taking up the matter again with the Pakistan government for the Third International Netaji Seminar in 1979”.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Bose also sent separate invitations to Malik and Shah.</p>
<p>An MEA note of July 1978 said that “it could be explained to the bureau that it would not be possible for us to ensure the participation of the two Pakistani nationals concerned, as the Pakistan government would eventually decide on its own whether or not to allow the two persons travel to India”.</p>
<p>The MEA wrote back to Bose in September 1978 that the government “would certainly assist you, to the extent possible&#8230;we cannot, however, presume on the Government of Pakistan’s response”.</p>

<p>Jharkhand Ispat Pvt Limited (JIPL) directors R C Rungta and R S Rungta, convicted earlier this month in a coal block allocation scam case, approached Delhi High Court Friday to appeal against their conviction. The Rungtas were the first to be convicted in the coal block allocation scam cases.</p>
<p>Senior advocates Kapil Sibal and K V Vishwanathan appeared on behalf of the Rungtas, who have been convicted for criminal conspiracy and cheating by a special CBI court and sentenced to four years of rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>The CBI court, in its April 4 judgment, had also imposed a fine of Rs 5 lakh each on the Rungtas and Rs 25 lakh on JIPL in connection with irregularities in the allocation of North Dhadu coal block in Jharkhand.</p>
<p>The bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul has for now issued a notice to CBI, and will hear the plea challenging their conviction, as well as an application for interim suspension of sentence, on May 6.</p>

<p>During the brief hearing, Advocate Tarannum Cheema, appearing for CBI, informed the bench that senior advocate R S Cheema, who had been appointed special prosecutor for trial of coal block cases by Supreme Court, will also be appearing as special prosecutor in the appeal. The advocate said that since the matter is being monitored by the Supreme Court, CBI would apprise the court about the filing of appeal too. The agency has also sought time to file a reply, as a copy of the appeal had not yet been supplied to the prosecutor.</p>
<p>The plea, filed through advocate Vivek Chib, has challenged the conviction on grounds that the offence of cheating could not have been made out, as there was “no misrepresentation” of facts by JIPL with regard to their kiln capacity.</p>
<p>“The ingredients of Section 420 and Section 120B of the IPC are not made out,” says the application, adding that as the allocation of the coal blocks had been quashed, there had not been any transfer of valuable property to the company as a result of the alleged “misrepresentation and cheating.”</p>
<p>In its judgment, the trial court had dismissed the Rungtas’ argument that there had been “no loss to the exchequer” as there was no extraction of coal.</p>
<p>Special Judge Bharat Parasher, in his judgment, had noted that “white collar crimes’ are in fact more dangerous to society than ordinary crimes,” and had dismissed the convicts’ plea that there had been no financial loss.</p>
<p>Non-extraction of coal and non-completion of the end-use project has caused huge loss to the nation which is difficult to be computed in monetary terms, the court had said. “The fact remains that a coal block came to be allocated to JIPL on account of the acts of cheating committed by the convict persons pursuant to a criminal conspiracy hatched by them,” it had added.</p>
<p>The plea has also alleged that since original files of the coal ministry were “damaged” in a fire, the documents relied upon by CBI were “reconstructed records” whose authenticity had “not been proved under the evidence Act.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777182&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Source: PTI)
<p>The government Friday released the third set of files related to the death of <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/netaji-subhas-chandra-bose/">Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose</a>. The latest files pertain to the correspondence between various political leaders and government functionaries between 1990 and 2006 regarding the supposed death of Bose in an air crash in 1945.</p>
<p>The new set of 25 declassified files comprise five files handed over to the National Archives of India by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) last year, five from the Home Ministry and the remaining from the External Affairs Ministry. One of the files contains a news report carried by The Statesman on October 5, 1991, citing correspondence between the office of then PM Morarji Desai and Bose’s family members as well as senior leaders from Janata Dal in Bengal regarding the enquiry on the said crash.</p>
<p>The files were released online on web portal <a href="http://www.netajipapers.gov.in" rel="nofollow">http://www.netajipapers.gov.in</a> by Tourism and Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma. On the occasion, Sharma also announced the government’s plan to set up a memorial for Bose “in the heart of the Capital”.</p>

<p>Two commissions of enquiry had concluded that Bose died in a plane crash in Taipei on August 18, 1945, while a third probe panel had suggested that no such crash took place. In 1977, Bose’s relatives and some senior Janata Dal leaders from Bengal wrote to Desai, saying that they want conclusive proof of Bose’s death in the crash &#8211; such as what time did the crash happen, who all were accompanying Bose and the circumstances of the crash. These details have come out in the public domain through the latest set of files released.</p>
<p>Sharma said, “The people of this country, specially the youth, want to know about the life of Netaji, and his contribution towards the freedom struggle. The declassification is aimed at making the information public for scholars and researchers.”</p>
<p>He added, “People of this country also want to know why the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> leadership at that time, under PM Morarji Desai, had kept this information from the media and general public. By the time the last set of files is released, the mystery surrounding Netaji’s death for so many decades will be cleared.”</p>

<p><em>Excerpts from the interview:</em></p>
<p><strong>Will the Christian community get behind any force in this election?</strong></p>
<p>Never has the whole community stood behind any particular party. There are local prejudices and external influences like the media. This has been the case in the past elections, too.</p>
<p><strong>The Church advises the faithful before voting. What are the concerns the community bears in mind?</strong></p>
<p>We are concerned about the education policy and the freedom to practice and propagate the faith. Also, the issue of reservation for Dalit Christians. We have been concerned about increasing alcoholism. The agrarian crisis too is a key issue. On many of these issues, UDF has been favourable to Christians. They have limitations too. For example, the reservation issue is something the Centre has to address. It is not easy, or possible, in the present scenario. In the education sector, we have faced problems with UDF, but they have been better than LDF. On the agrarian front, we had issues with recommendations of Kasturirangan committee. The stand of some people in UDF on the issue irked us. Although the UDF manifesto promises us a lot, history says manifestos are not to be relied on.</p>
<p><strong>Is freedom to practice and propagate religion a new concern with <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> in power at the Centre and its influence in Kerala?</strong></p>
<p>The BJP has no influence in Kerala. But at national level, the developments have been alarming. Churches have been attacked. There have been assurances, but nothing has changed. Their attitude has been aimed at building a Hindu state.</p>
<p><strong>But Christian leaders have been meeting the PM and others regularly? Bishop Philipose Mar Chrysostom, Metropolitan of Mar Thoma Church has been quoted as saying he found BJP “quite ok”.</strong></p>
<p>I do not know if he was quoted correctly. Our people visit him because he is the PM, not because he is a BJP man. Even BJP has different faces. BJP under Atal Bihari Vajpayee was different. The community is shaken by some policies of this BJP.</p>
<p><strong>There is an allegation that the Church puts pressure on political parties to give tickets to its people.</strong></p>
<p>As a principle, Church leaders do not get directly involved with politics. We may put some points before people through our teachings. Some people may feel that as a community we have not been taken into account during selection of candidates. They may speak to some leaders about it.<br />
Every community tries to get a good representation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777178&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2777186" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/kerala-7592.jpg" alt="K M Mani, Pala, Kerala Congress (M), kerala, kerala assembky elections 2016, Christian-dominated constituency, pala Christians, kerala news" /> Nuns outside a poll office of Kerala <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> (Mani). Express
<p>K M Mani’s name has become synonymous with Pala. The Kerala Congress (M) leader has represented this Christian-dominated constituency in the Assembly since 1965, when it was formed. But this time, Mani may be up for a tough fight owing to anti-incumbency, factionalism in his party, acute agrarian crisis in the region, and corruption charges against him.</p>
<p>“It is time Pala has a different MLA. It looks like the constituency is heading for a change,” said Shaji, an LIC agent in the town.</p>
<p>A Pathrose, a labourer associated with rubber tapping, said: “His (Mani’s) image has been dented. He has failed to protect small-scale rubber farmers (a majority in the constituency). People are also disappointed with the way he promotes his family members.”</p>
<p>V J Joseph, a farmer, is disenchanted with Mani and his party. He believes LDF candidate Mani C Kappen—an NCP leader who lost to Mani in 2011 by 5,259 votes—is popular enough to defeat Mani. “There are undercurrents against him. But in the last minute, the Bishops ensure that he wins. All nuns in more than a dozen convents in Pala will vote for him,” Joseph said.</p>

<p>Not just Mani, many candidates in the Congress-led UDF rely on support of Christians, especially in central Kerala, where the community is influential. Hence, UDF has been protective of the community’s interests.</p>
<p>The UDF government’s liquor policy and prohibition has not gone well with a section of the community, which says it has put thousands out of a job and “taken the fun out of life”. The men, who used to enjoy “two-three pegs after the day’s hard work” are disappointed. But the women are happy. “At least the men are home in the evenings,” said Mary, a housewife. A pre-poll directive from Kerala Catholic Bishops Conference has asked the community to reject those who oppose prohibition.</p>
<p>The Christian community in Kerala comprises various denominations with followers owing allegiance to Catholic, Syrian Church or Anglican Church. The Church leadership, which has fundamental differences with Communists, had at one point advised the faithful not to vote for “atheist parties”. Although the hostility has reduced, due to change in the Left’s approach to the community, community leaders say the church still cannot accept the Left’s stand on faith.</p>
<p>The Left has managed to woo Christians among the fishermen and Marthomites — whom the RSS considers true Indian Christians — and the Orthodox Church has publicly declared its pro-<a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> stand. But, largely, the community has remained loyal to the UDF so far.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding its fight with the Church on religious conversion, <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> has been trying to woo Christians in Kerala for some time now, especially after its leadership felt that consolidation of Hindus in its favour would not be easy. A remark by Philipose Mar Chrysostom, Metropolitan of Mar Thoma Church, during the election campaign has given hopes to BJP. Party insiders say the Marthoma church’s support could help BJP candidate Sreedharan Pillai in Chengannoor, considered a Congress bastion.</p>
<p>Paul Zachariah, writer and political analyst, does not believe the Church has any role in politics: “It cannot influence the community, except some elders. But the poor and illiterate people in the coastal lines are different. They have closer ties with the Church.”</p>
<p>Political observers said BJP could attract a section of Christians because of the influence of NRI community, among whom Modi is a favourite, also because of the party’s approach to Muslims. “Yes, the community has anti-Islamic feeling due to economic and historical reasons. Muslims have moved ahead as they are more enterprising businessmen. They have no inhibition in taking up any job whereas Christians still have prejudices,” Zachariah said.<br />
However, he added that BJP has so far not been able to exploit this “feeling” to its advantage.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2777176 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/bengal-759.jpg" alt="west bengal assembly elections 2016, west bengal polling booth, transgender, polling booth transgender, west bengal transgender, west bengal news, west bengal polls, Rashbehari Assembly constituency" /> At South City International School booth, Riya Sarkar, 29, will be India’s first transgender presiding officer.
<p>A breathless Riya Sarkar, 29, walks into Ballygunge Government High School in south Kolkata to collect her election material. “Am I late?” she asks Anjana Bhattacharya, in-charge of the distribution centre, who reassures her with a firm handshake. “We are proud that you have decided to take part in this celebration of democracy,” Bhattacharya says before leading Sarkar to the distribution room.</p>
<p>It’s 11 am and the centre is teeming with polling officers. Sarkar, like hundreds of other officials, joins the queue to collect her poll material. They all look nervous, they are all “scared about handling an entire polling booth”, as Malati Saha, another polling officer, puts it. But Sarkar, who on Saturday will become the first transgender person in India to preside over a polling booth — number 260 in South City International School (Rashbehari Assembly constituency) — will have the additional responsibility of creating history. “I hope everything goes well,” she says.</p>

<p>Sarkar has decided she will come dressed in a sari to the booth. She wants to “make sure” that everyone addresses her as “madam”. “All my life people have made fun of me; now I am confident enough to assert myself,” says Sarkar, a teacher at Dum Dum Prachya Bani Mandir for Boys.</p>
<p>She was approached by Smita Pandey, the district electoral officer, Kolkata South, for the job as the polling officer. “She (Pandey) said I had to do this for my community. She felt if more transwomen like me come forward, there will be more acceptance,” Sarkar said.</p>
<p>Pandey, who shortlisted 24 other transgenders to be polling officers, said she was disappointed at not being able to involve other members of the community in the electoral process. “The Election Commission has a rule that only government employees can be polling officers. None of the transpersons we shortlisted, apart from Riya Sarkar, were government employees,” Pandey said.</p>
<p>Of the 6.5 crore voters in West Bengal, the number of registered voters from the third gender is 758.</p>

<p>Five months after Union Finance Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/arun-jaitley/">Arun Jaitley</a> filed a civil defamation suit against Delhi Chief Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/arvind-kejriwal/">Arvind Kejriwal</a> and five other AAP leaders for allegedly making defamatory statements regarding his role in the “financial mismanagement” of the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA), the court is yet to frame issues and start trial of the suit.</p>
<p>Jaitley has sought Rs 10 crore in damages from Kejriwal, Raghav Chadha, Kumar Vishwas, Ashutosh, Sanjay Singh and Deepak Bajpai for issuing allegedly false and defamatory statements against him and his family members in connection with alleged irregularities in DDCA when he was its president.</p>
<p>The case remains at the stage of filing of documents, with the Delhi High Court Friday allowing the AAP leaders to submit their written response on two documents, which, according to them, had been “added’ to the original suit when the Union finance minister had filed his response to the replies filed by AAP leaders.</p>

<p>The AAP leaders had filed applications alleging that Jaitley had raised “new allegations” in the civil suit, while filing his replication, which is not allowed.</p>
<p>A replication is the written submission filed by the plaintiff in a civil suit, after the defendant files their reply to the issues raised in the plaint. New allegations and issues cannot be raised in a replication.</p>
<p>The AAP leaders had sought court orders to strike off the “new allegations”. They had also argued that Jaitley had “attempted to enlarge the scope of the suit” by including two new documents in the replication. During arguments, senior advocate H S Phoolka, arguing for the AAP leaders, said the “fresh allegations” had not been part of the original case.</p>
<p>“You will confine yourself only to the two documents which, as per you, have been added in the replication,” said Justice Vipin Sanghi. The matter will now be heard on July 12.</p>
<p>Senior advocates Rajiv Nayar, Sandeep Sethi and Pratibha M Singh, appearing for Jaitley, told the court that the two documents mentioned in the applications by AAP leaders were part of the original plaint.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2777321" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/narada-kolkata-759.jpg" alt="A wall graffiti at Behala East. (Express Photo by Partha Paul)" /> A wall graffiti at Behala East. (Express Photo by Partha Paul)
<p>Tainted by the Narada sting tapes, that showed them purportedly taking money, four Trinamool <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> (TMC) leaders, including three ministers in Mamata Banerjee’s outgoing government, are in the fray in Saturday’s sixth-phase polling. All of them considered very close to the chief minister — in fact, part of her core group — they are eyeing the polls, and the results on May 19, with extra attention.</p>
<p>For, an election victory would give them a “referendum” for coming clean. These leaders, like almost all the others who featured in the Narada sting, are extremely popular among the masses and have a charismatic appeal. The electoral outcome is being seen as the first step for many to get absolved from the charges — at least in the court of people.</p>
<p>Contesting from Behala East is Kolkata Mayor Sovan Chatterjee, a Narada-tainted figure. Chatterjee, the sitting MLA, is also president of South-24 Parganas district TMC, and one of Mamata’s closest lieutenants. He enjoyed immense official responsibilities and had been given charge of grooming Abhishek Banerjee, Mamata’s nephew.</p>
<p>As the district TMC president with a strong grip over the party, Chatterjee played a huge role in Abhishek’s victory in 2014 from Diamond Harbour <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/">Lok Sabha</a> constituency.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Chatterjee will take on a man who has no love lost for Mamata — Ambikesh Mahapatra, the Jadavpur University professor who was jailed for circulating online a cartoon of the CM and party’s senior leader Mukul Roy, incidentally also accused in the Narada sting. Mahapatra, along with retired Supreme Court judge Ashok Ganguly among others, had formed Akranta Amra (We Are Attacked) to launch a popular movement against the Mamata government. The Left-Congress alliance has not put up any candidate in Behala East to ensure the seat becomes a one-on-one contest between Chatterjee and Mahapatra.</p>
<p>Subrata Mukherjee, who defends his seat from Ballygunge, had also featured in the Narada sting and is one of the seniormost ministers, with the portfolio of panchayat and rural development. The veteran politician he is, Mukherjee is confident in the run-up to the polls. Although not willing to speak on Narada, he knows that a victory would give him a better manouvering space.</p>
<p>Then there is Firhad Hakim — a close lieutenant of Mamata, the urban development minister in her government, a popular face among her Muslim votebank, and who has featured in the Narada tapes.</p>
<p>Hakim, who will defend his seat in Kolkata Port, has also come up from the grassroots, having contested and risen from the Kolkata municipal polls and gaining in stature as a leader over the years. But he now has to bear the double weight of Narada and the collapsed Vivekananda Bridge in North Kolkata — as the UD minister, it was under his jurisdiction and responsibility.</p>
<p>Iqbal Ahmed is another TMC leader who was shown on the Narada sting and is alleged to have acted as the “middleman”, taking the journalists posing as businessmen interested in corporate ventures in Bengal to meet different leaders. Not shown to have taken any money in the sting tapes, Iqbal is contesting from Khanakool constituency in Hooghly. He is also a close relative of Sultan Ahmed, the TMC MP who was shown purportedly accepting bribe in the tapes.</p>
<p>Going by sheer record, all the four are extremely winnable candidates. But records and past statistics, as they say in cricket, do not often show how the wind blows on D-day. For that, all four will eagerly wait for May 19.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2777167" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/west-bengal-7592.jpg" alt="west bengal assembly elections 2016, Mamata Banerjee, trinamool congress, TMC, Bhawanipur, BJP, amit shah, 2014 General Election, Tathagatha Roy, india news" /> Residents of Bhawanipur say they have never seen a high-voltage campaign like this year’s. Partha Paul
<p>Residents of Bhawanipur in south Kolkata woke up to a unique message on Thursday. It was a letter, signed by Mamata Banerjee, the West Bengal Chief Minister and their candidate. Signed by Mamata, the letter urges Bhawanipur’s voters to press the button for her Trinamool <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> (TMC) and “pave the way for better growth and greater development in West Bengal over the next five years”.</p>
<p>While some residents said the letter arrived by mail, several others said it had been slipped in along with the morning newspapers. No one, however, was really surprised at this unusual gesture. After all, in these elections spread over a month across 294 constituencies, this is what it eventually boils down to — the battle for Bhawanipur.<br />
As <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> president Amit Shah put it when he had come here for campaigning on Thursday, the last day of campaigning before the fifth phase of polling in the state, “In order to defeat Trinamool Congress, you don’t need to get a majority. You need to win one seat: Bhawanipur.”</p>
<p>TMC, explained BJP and Left leaders, was less a party and more a cult — centred around Mamata Banerjee. And defeating her is all that matters to bring the party down. Little wonder that most people in the constituency say they have never seen a high-tempo fight like this year’s for this seat.</p>

<p>There are 2,02,655 voters in the constituency, and all of them will count on Saturday. In 2011, Mamata Banerjee won the bypoll from Bhawanipur seat with a margin of more than 50,000 votes. But that was another time — the time of Mamata’s Paribartan wave. In 2014 General Election, the BJP candidate from Kolkata South <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/">Lok Sabha</a> seat, Tathagatha Roy, managed a slender lead of 185 seats in Bhawanipore Assembly segment. But that, too, was another time — the high tide during the Modi wave.</p>
<p>To take on ‘Didi’, the Congress has this time fielded Deepa Dasmunsi, wife of veteran Congress leader Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi and also called ‘Boudi’ (sister-in-law). Having wound up her breathless, uber-visible, door-to-door campaign, Dasmunsi said, “Mamata Banerjee is worried. She didn’t take us seriously. Now she knows it’s different.”</p>
<p>In comparison, BJP candidate Chandra Kumar Bose, a grandnephew of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, initially ran a lacklustre campaign. BJP leaders said he was unable to find even an office space for himself, blaming it on highhandedness of “local Trinamool” leaders. But the party tried to make up with a last-minute surge — on the last day of campaigning, it put its entire weight behind Bose. Party president Amit Shah and actor Paresh Rawal led the campaign on Wednesday, with BJP national secretary Sidharth Nath Singh and actors-turned-politicians Roopa Ganguly and Locket Chatterjee joining in.</p>
<p>While the BJP hopes it has done enough to get the votes of the expanding pockets of Gujaratis and Sikhs in the area — traditionally BJP voters — Bose’s strategy has been simpler. His campaign posters have been designed in a manner to underscore his facial resemblance with Netaji, and he has introduced himself as the ‘Netaji scion’.</p>
<p>But despite the bravado both Dasmunsi and Bose have admitted at different points in their campaign that fighting Mamata in Bhawanipur is a formidable task. A resident of Kalighat, the Trinamool supremo has worked extensively with the area’s many clubs — these are social organisations in different localities that exert considerable influence in pockets, and Mamata’s campaign drew on that. Her first padyatra (march) in the constituency ended near Hazra crossing, the place where a near-fatal attack on her in August 1990 forged Mamata’s political identity.</p>
<p>Then with the Congress, Mamata was leading a rally that day. Standing at the spot 26 years on, she said, “I have worked tirelessly for the people here. All the clubs here know how I work, and so do the people. I am a resident of this area. This is my home. I have come to ask for your blessings.”</p>
<p>And that is the challenge for the Congress-Left alliance and the BJP — beating Mamata Banerjee at her “home”, a constituency from where she rose, and now a seat that encapsulates the battle for Bengal.</p>

<p>A day after JNU sent a notice to Anirban Bhattacharya for his alleged participation in the screening of a film, Muzaffarnar Baaqi Hai, last August, the university Friday issued a similar notice to rusticated student Umar Khalid.</p>
<p>“A complaint against you was received by the chief proctor’s office in August, 2015. It has been alleged that you were involved in participation in screening of a documentary-film&#8230; without permission of the administration. You are directed to appear before the proctor on May 4 and explain your position&#8230;,” said the notice.</p>

<p>The much-awaited 18.1 km east-west corridor (Purple Line) of Bengaluru Metro was inaugurated Friday and will be thrown open for the public from Saturday morning. The east-west corridor comprises a 5.12-km underground section which makes the Namma Metro or Bengaluru Metro the first in South India to have an operational underground section. The work on the corridor began in 2006 and was delayed because the underground section required tunneling through rocks.</p>
<p>With the opening of the east-west corridor, a total of 28 km of the first phase of Bengaluru Metro, spanning 42 km, has become operational. On the 24-km north-south line, the metro is currently operational in a 10-km stretch in north Bengaluru from Peenya to Swastik Circle. Prior to opening of the east-west line on Friday, only 6.7 km in east Bangalore had been operational on the east-west line.</p>
<p>The small 6.7 km section was opened in October 2011 and has served only as a sample of the transformation that the metro can bring to urban transport in Bengaluru that is reeling under traffic congestion.</p>
<p>The first phase is being built at a cost of Rs 13,800 crore.</p>
<p>Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said the fully-operational east west line would improve commute in the city. The remaining portion of phase-I of Namma Metro would be completed within a few months, he said. “I expect the completion of the all pending works within four months,’’ he said.</p>

<p>“The 72 km phase-II of Namma Metro will cost Rs 26,405 crore and work has already commenced. If all goes well, the phase II of Namma Metro will become operational by 2020. The state government will contribute Rs 9000 crore for this project. It has already released Rs 900 crore. The remaining amount will be released in the near future,’’ Siddaramaiah said. He also said that survey work for phase-III had begun. “In the future, around 20 lakh commuters will use the Namma Metro train service in Bengaluru,’’ he said.</p>
<p>Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, who attended the inauguration ceremony, assured that the Centre is cooperating with the Karnataka government in realizing phase three of the Metro project for which the feasibility study is underway.</p>
<p>The cost of a train ticket from Biayappanahalli in east Bengaluru to Nayandahalli in west Bengaluru is Rs 40. “It is cheaper than the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation bus fare.We offer 15 per cent discount for smart card users. There are two smart cards — value and varshik. We expect two lakh commuters to use Namma Metro service from April 30,’’ Bangalore Metro chief Pradeep Kharola said.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2777117" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/start-up.jpg" alt="The increasing IT penetration in the country, leading to direct employment generation of around 3.5 million till 2014-15 is another comfort, along with the potential of a young and educated consumer base." /> The increasing IT penetration in the country, leading to direct employment generation of around 3.5 million till 2014-15 is another comfort, along with the potential of a young and educated consumer base.
<p>Corporate real estate (CRE) strategies play an important role in the business of start-ups across the globe. As start-ups look for new ways to reduce costs and remain profitable amid increasing competition, making the right real estate choices can go a long way in sustaining their innovative businesses. For a thriving start-up ecosystem in India, evaluating one’s existing and future space needs will be a critical factor for overall business efficiency.</p>
<p>Globally, India is today the third largest base for start-ups. The leading reasons for this are the strong macro-economic and demographic fundamentals of the country. India’s large youth population, as well as its thriving IT and e-commerce sectors ensures a captive talent pool. Moreover, increased instances of funding along with a growing propensity among average Indian entrepreneurs to take chances and start out on their own have also fuelled India’s position as a start-up hub in recent years. The government has also encouraged entrepreneurship by launching initiatives such as Start-up India, Digital India and Make in India.</p>
<p>Despite these factors, however, start-up firms still face several inherent challenges while establishing their businesses. Issues of funding, inexperienced entrepreneurs, limited support systems and brand visibility can lead to difficulty in sustaining operations. The following are a few key strengths and challenges for India as a global start-up destination, as highlighted by a recent CBRE report.</p>
<p><strong>India’s strengths</strong></p>
<p>A key strength lies in India’s sound economic environment, with an expected GDP growth of 7.5–7.7 per cent in 2015–16, coupled with recent proactive government initiatives to boost this segment. The increasing IT penetration in the country, leading to direct employment generation of around 3.5 million till 2014-15 is another comfort, along with the potential of a young and educated consumer base. India is currently home to the largest youth base, with more than 356 million people between the ages of 10–24 years (2015 Census figures).</p>
<p>India, moreover, houses the second largest smartphone user base after China across the globe, with an approximate user base of 220 million in 2015. Potentially high returns of the sector have attracted multiple investors in recent times. Prominent high net-worth individuals (HNIs), such as Ratan Tata, have invested in more than 25 start-ups across various industries in India in less than two years.</p>
<p>The rising affinity for niche, personalised services among Indian consumers has been yet another consideration in favour of India as a global start-up hub. Indian consumers have been increasingly relying on social media to make informed choices on their purchases, influenced by sites that include advertisements, product reviews, and new product launch announcements, among others. Indians have also lately been increasingly open to high risk-return careers, providing additional comfort to India as a global hub for attracting entrepreneurial and innovative minds to the sector.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The country, however, faces a few challenges in the form of difficulty in brand visibility, leading to a small target consumer base. Limited support infrastructure, including online payment issues, fake orders, and inexperienced consumers, etc., are other concerns in this field.</p>
<p>Untested business models that may result in high cash burn rates is another concern area. In many cases, inexperienced entrepreneurs may pose challenges as well. The lack of adequate managerial skills in the country is a concern, particularly for nascent start-ups.</p>
<p>The abundance of a technically skilled workforce and India’s demographic and economic dividend have created immense opportunities for a thriving start-up ecosystem, however, and are likely to help override most concerns posing as challenges for India’s growth as an international destination for start-up firms.</p>

<p>With residential housing sales not witnessing a pick-up despite a 150-basis point cut in rates by the Reserve Bank of India over the last 16 months, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has called for a cut in real estate prices in a bid to encourage homebuyers to enter the market and buy properties.</p>
<p>The call from the RBI Governor comes at a time when the industry remains saddled with high unsold inventories and many within the industry terming 2015 as one of the worst years for the sector in a decade in terms of sales and new launches.</p>
<p>“I am hopeful that as interest rates come down, there will be more credit and buying. And I am also hopeful that prices adjust in a way that encourage people to buy,” Rajan said earlier this week in Mumbai. He added, “there is a little bit of everything that needs to happen” for the revival in the real estate sector.</p>
<p>The realty industry has been quick to react to the governor’s call and has responded by saying that the market has already witnessed price correction over the last three years as they have declined by around 30 per cent.</p>

<p>“There has been consistent correction in property prices in the past 3 years by nearly 35 to 40 per cent across the industry. In fact nearly 90 per cent of the home supply in the country has already shown price correction. Given the ever increasing cost of land and cost of construction any further fall in prices will only lead to non performing assets (NPAs) and non delivery of projects,” said Amit Modi, director, ABA Corp and vice president of Credai, western UP.</p>
<p>But the residential price data for last three years accessed from Knight Frank reveals that the average price across the major markets have either gone up or have remained stable.</p>
<p>Data on Housing Price Index (HPI) released by the Reserve Bank of India on Thursday showed that housing prices across the country rose during the quarter ended December 2015. While the highest price increase was witnessed in Lucknow, Jaipur saw a mild correction in prices during the quarter against the corresponding quarter last year.</p>
<p>The HPI-All India rose to 221.7 in third quarter of FY16 from 218.2 in the previous three-month period. However, as homebuyers stayed away from the market, there has been a moderation in the pace of price increase. “The annual increase of HPI-All India moderated since Q1, FY16. During Q3, FY16, the rate of increase fell below 10 per cent,” RBI said.</p>
<p>The RBI released the data for the entire country and 10 major cities — Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Kanpur and Kochi for the October-December quarter of 2015-16.</p>
<p>Another set of real estate price data accessed from Knight Frank for eight major cities — Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Ahmedabad — shows that all the eight cities have seen the average residential price going up by 3 to 15 per cent between 2013 and 2015.</p>
<p>While average prices in Bengaluru went up 15 per cent from Rs 4,158 per sq ft (psf) in 2013 to Rs 4,780 psf in 2015, average prices in Mumbai rose by 12.8 per cent in the same period from Rs 7,085 psf to Rs 7,994 psf. While the Delhi NCR market witnessed a price increase of 7.4 per cent, Kolkata and Chennai remained the most stable as prices went up by 3.1 per cent and 5.6 per cent, respectively.</p>
<p>Also, according to a report released by online real estate firm PropTiger earlier this month, both the sales and new project launches for the top 9 cities for the year ended March 2016 slid to a three-year low.</p>
<p>While factors such as lower-than-expected economic growth, slowdown in job creation played a role in decline in demand, factors such as prevailing high real estate prices, high interest rates and delay in delivery of projects by the developers have also played a big part in keeping prospective homebuyers on the sidelines over the last few years.</p>
<p>Pointing at the need for adjustment so that more people want to go and buy houses, Rajan said that apart from interest rates, measures such as including affordable housing loans under the priority sector lending requirements will encourage homebuyers. He also called for greater transparency. “We need action on real side (as) also on transparency on land acquisition, on transparency on construction and on sales,” he added.</p>
<p>On the other hand, while developers have been claiming to have reduced the prices, they also say that there is a limitation to the price cuts that they can bring in as there is a fixed cost that they work on and if they reduce the prices further they would be operating in losses.</p>
<p>Anuj Goel, executive director of KDP Developers said: “Service tax, VAT, registry cost and various other government levies only add to the fixed cost and hence leads to an overall increase in the basic cost of a project. If any further reduction is done on our end the project would only act as a NPA for us.”</p>
<p>Concerns have also been raised on banks not fully passing on the benefit of repo rate cut (rate at which RBI lends to commercial banks) by the RBI and thus there is an issue of transmission of the same. While RBI has reduced the repo rate by 150 basis points, the banks have brought the lending rates down by up to 80 basis points.</p>
<p>“We sincerely hope that both finance ministry and the RBI push all the banks to transfer the entire benefit to the end consumer for whose benefit it is meant, else these moves will severely stop short of benefiting the consumer and only help in buffering the bottom lines of the banks,” said Modi.</p>
<p>The average price of residential units not coming down despite weak sales and rising inventory only shows that developers are also in a wait-and-watch mode and are looking to hold on to the prices in the hopes of a market revival. While they are not bringing the prices down they are also looking to sweeten the deal with some offers and by offering to pay the EMI till the time of possession.</p>
<p>An industry insider said that some developers are open to negotiation on the price with customers: “The developers are negotiating on price with serious buyers but are not announcing a cut in prices as they think that it will send a wrong signal in the market. Also they are looking to hold on to units and waiting for markets to improve instead of going for a cut in prices and reducing their overall realisation from the project.” He, however, added that the prices had moved significantly higher and they need to come down to attract the homebuyers.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2777108&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE AAP Friday announced that it would gherao Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a>’s residence if he failed to take decisive action against <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> president <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/sonia-gandhi/">Sonia Gandhi</a> and others named in the AgustaWestland deal in the next seven days. An emergency meeting of the party’s new political affairs committee was held to discuss the strategy if Sonia was not arrested in the case within one week.</p>
<p>The party’s Delhi convenor Dilip Pandey also wrote to the PM, asking why the Centre had failed to take action against the accused in the scam so far. “The AgustaWestland scam has brought great shame to the nation&#8230; The Modi government despite such an overwhelming majority&#8230; failed to make a single arrest. We demand to know what are the compulsions that make Narendra Modi protect the Gandhi family and others accused in this scam?”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2777053" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/agusta-deal.jpg" alt="AgustaWestland deal, AgustaWestland scam, AgustaWestland deal probe, Guido Haschke, Carlo Gerosa, VVIP Chopper deal, chopper scam, P Tyagi, vvip chopper scam, agusta westland scam, india chopper scam, vvip scam, india news, latest news" /> After the probes began, a lawyer had advised Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa to “keep business as usual”.
<p>Partners Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa, alleged middlemen in the AgustaWestland deal, had built such a complex maze of companies to route bribes to India that even after the probe began, they were confident no one would be caught. Phone conversations tapped by Italian authorities show that Haschke told Gerosa that even if investigations reached them, it would take agencies 10 years to reach Mauritius from where the money was being routed.</p>
<p>After the investigations began, they also discussed among themselves that a lawyer had advised them to “keep business as usual”, keep going to the AgustaWestland office and continue transfer of funds or else it would arouse suspicion and “would be an admission of guilt”.</p>
<p>The “guilt” was alleged payment of bribes that had begun in 2004, six years before the deal to supply 12 AgustaWestland helicopters to India was struck. The Tyagi brothers, cousins of former IAF chief S P Tyagi, had so convinced Haschke and AgustaWestland about swinging the deal in their favour that payments to them began in May 2004 itself, seven months before S P Tyagi became Air Chief Marshal.</p>

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEYBjqe0fs4&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
<p>These details are part of the prosecution complaint (chargesheet) filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against Delhi-based lawyer Gautam Khaitan and four others in connection with its money laundering probe into the Rs 3,600-crore chopper deal. The ED claims that Khaitan had a key role in moving the bribe money.</p>

<p>Quoting a recorded conversation dated March 3, 2012 between Haschke and Gerosa, which was presented in an Italian trial court, the prosecution complaint says: “Haschke and Gerosa state that even if investigation were to go ahead, it would be at least 10 years before money would be found in Mauritius. And that all the documentation relative to the relations between Haschke/Gerosa and AgustaWestland has already disappeared from their office in Lugano (Switzerland) and has been hidden in the house of Haschke’s mother, and the rest, Gerosa said he wanted to take to his house and hide in a wardrobe.”</p>
<p>Another conversation between the two shows that the group is worried about payments from AgustaWestland following the probe but feel that suspending payments would be an “admission of guilt”.</p>
<p><strong>Gerosa:</strong> <em>“No for argument’s sake, moreover, I don’t think they will stop paying completely now.” (The reference is to payments from AgustaWestland)</em><br />
<strong>Haschke:</strong> <em>“No I don’t think so.”</em><br />
<strong>Gerosa:</strong> <em>“It would be an admission of guilt.”</em><br />
<strong>Haschke:</strong> <em>“Not only would it be an admission of guilt, but it would also make us rebel, so that at that point we would have no interest to keep our mouths shut.”</em></p>
<p>Another conversation between Khaitan and Haschke outlines the nervousness in the group. Trying to calm Khaitan over the probe, Haschke says that he had cleaned his computer and made all documents and emails disappear. “There are no bank accounts directly connected to us in this country,” he tells Khaitan.</p>
<p>Haschke goes on: “&#8230;the lawyer told me not to stop going to AgustaWestland, just keep going with business as usual, as if nothing had happened, because otherwise it would look suspicious, why have you stopped? &#8230;And this is also the reason they will continue making all payments etc etc &#8230;business as usual, nothing, nothing &#8230;and stays perfectly clean.”</p>
<p>Haschke, who had been brought into the deal in 2004, allegedly by the Tyagi brothers by offering to swing the deal in favour of any company that he could bring to the table, was so confident of their abilities that he had begun payments to them from AgustaWestland in 2004 itself.</p>
<p>The prosecution complaint notes: “Tyagi brothers namely Sanjeev, Rajeev and Sandeep, cousins of SP Tyagi, who had long acquaintance with Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa &#8230;entered into a consultancy contract with Gordan Services Sarl, Tunisia in 2004. Gordon Services was linked to Haschke and Gerosa. The Tyagi brothers received Euro 1.26 lakh after May, 2004 and Euro 2 lakh after February, 2005 &#8230;Tyagi brothers, including S P Tyagi, also received some amount in cash.”</p>
<p>According to ED, in the ‘offset’ (work to be mandatorily done in India) category, AgustaWestland set aside Euro 70 million which would be transferred to the companies floated by two groups of middlemen — one led by Haschke and Gerosa and the other led by Christian Michel.</p>
<p>“The real deal was, however, that of the 70 million euros, only 30 per cent would be utilised for actual work including engineering services and media handling while the rest would be diverted to pay bribes,” the official said.</p>
<p>To facilitate this, a maze of companies was set up to move money across borders and camouflage bribes. While Christian Michel set up Global Services FZE in Dubai, Haschke set up IDS Tunisia, IDS Mauritius and Aeromatrix.</p>
<p>Consequently, Michel was supposed to get Euro 42 million while Haschke was to be given Euro 28 million.</p>
<p>According to ED, the legitimate part of the offset money earmarked for Haschke by AgustaWestland went to IDS India (it was not part of middlemen maze). The bribe was sent to IDS Tunisia which subsequently sent it to IDS Mauritius. It was IDS Mauritius that allegedly paid the bribes to Tyagi brothers.</p>
<p>When IDS India sensed there was something wrong with the way the work was happening, the Haschke-led group, along with Khaitan, floated Aeromatrix which finally bought the engineering department of IDS India, the ED claimed.</p>
<p>Aeromatrix would receive orders for engineering services from AgustaWestland but would raise invoice to IDS Tunisia at the rate of Euro 14 per man hour. IDS Tunisia would further inflate the bills on the ground of added work and charge AgustaWestland at the rate of Euro 34 per man hour. This despite the fact that IDS Tunisia added no value to the product and had a total of one employee who was its director. This difference, says ED, was paid as bribes.</p>
<p>The ED is now hoping it would get a chance to interrogate Michel to unearth who all he paid bribes too.</p>

<p>UNDER ATTACK from the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> and the government over the AgustaWestland chopper deal, the Congress Friday dared the government to “stop the tamasha” and “malicious campaign”, and complete the probe within two months and place its findings in Parliament when it meets for monsoon session.</p>
<p>Two Rajya Sabha MPs of the Congress also gave a notice to move breach of privilege motion against Defence Minister Manohar Parikkar for his ministry issuing a statement on the deal outside the House when Parliament was in session.</p>
<p>Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said at a press conference that it was surprising to see that the entire Cabinet right from morning to evening was busy “giving bytes”, “participating in channel discussions” and “giving interviews” on the issue. For the past nearly 40 years, the BJP had been indulging in leveling unsubstantiated allegations, he said.</p>

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEYBjqe0fs4&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
<p>“Old habits die hard. They are still doing the same&#8230; If the leadership of the UPA, leadership of the Congress or its ministers had taken bribes from AgustaWestland, would it have shown the courage to order a CBI and ED inquiry. Would it have scrapped the deal, initiated the process to black list the company&#8230;,” he said.</p>

<p>“If this government is honest about bringing out the truth, want to get to the root of this issue, stop giving bytes from morning to evening to television channels and selectively leaking defence files&#8230; bring out the names of those people who took money.”</p>
<p>“The Italian court has decided on who had given the money&#8230; the responsibility of finding who recieved the money is with the Government of India. End this tamasha&#8230; stop the disinformation campaign&#8230; we also want to know who took money in this deal, how much and how. If this government has the guts, complete the probe within two months and tell Parliament when the monsoon session commences,” he said.</p>
<p>Congress MPs Shantaram Naik and Hussain Dalwai gave the notice for moving a breach of privilege motion against Parikkar. Their contention is that his ministry issued a statement explaining the sequence of events. “When Parliament is in session, he cannot issue a statement outside the House. That amounts to breach of privilege of the House and the members,” sources said. Naik demanded that his notice be referred to the privilege committee. “It was incumbent on the Defence Minister that if at all wanted to give some clarification that should have been given on the floor of the House,” Azad said.</p>
<p>The Congress also questioned the Defence Ministry’s version, saying it peddled “half-truths”.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Targeting Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on the issue of VVIP chopper scam, BJP national president Amit Shah on Friday asked her why was AgustaWestland given a number of relaxations compromising national interest.</p>
<p>Talking to mediapersons, he directed several questions to Sonia Gandhi. He said that before the deal for the chopper was finalised, the Italian media had carried reports of corruption in it and yet the UPA government led by Congress went ahead with the deal. He said the UPA government should have put the deal on hold immediately.</p>
<p>Stating that the deal was put on hold only in 2013, Shah asked Sonia Gandhi as to why there was a delay in putting the deal on hold despite corruption having been proved in it.</p>

<p>The BJP chief said that the tender for purchase of choppers allowed only original equipment manufacturers (OEM) to participate in the bid, but why was AgustaWestland allowed to bid when it was not an OEM. &#8220;Who was behind the changes in the tender conditions? Who gave the certificate that the company was technically qualified for the deal? And why were the changes in tender conditions made?&#8221; Shah questioned Sonia Gandhi.</p>
<p>Posing another question, Shah said that one of the conditions of the tender was that a field trial of the choppers would be done in India. But this condition was later on changed and the company was permitted to do a field trial in its premises in Italy only.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why were the conditions relaxed? Who gave the permission for it? Did the then Defence Minister gave permission for it? Was it not against national interest? Sonia Gandhi must reply to these questions,&#8221; Shah said.</p>

<p>Replying to Congress accusations that the Modi government had not properly investigated the scam in the last two years, Shah said that it amounted to a &#8220;thief scolding a cop&#8221;.</p>

<p>The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) Friday issued summons to former IAF chief S P Tyagi and some others in connection with their investigation into the VVIP chopper scam. The agencies asked them to appear before them within 15 days for questioning.</p>
<p>The CBI has also summoned retired Air Marshal J S Gujral, who was present in the March 2005 meeting where technical specifications for VVIP choppers were discussed in the presence of Tyagi and then NSA M K Narayanan.</p>
<p>While Gujral has been asked to appear before CBI on Saturday, Tyagi has been asked to present himself on Monday. CBI has questioned both of them earlier.</p>

<p>Tyagi was Air Chief Marshal between 2005 and 2007 when required specifications for VVIP choppers were altered to favour AgustaWestland. His cousins, Sanjeev, Sandeep and Rajeev, allegedly received bribes from middlemen to swing the deal. The money, says ED sources, is also suspected to have reached Tyagi.</p>
<p>“Summons have been issued in light of the judgment of Milan Court of Appeals which has convicted the accused of corruption. Tyagi will be questioned on his role in altering specifications to favour Agusta and the bribe he is suspected to have received,” an ED official said. The ED has earlier questioned Tyagi’s cousins, but has summoned them again as some fresh details have come to the fore, said sources.</p>
<p>ED claims that Tyagi’s brothers began looking for a defence middleman as soon as it became clear that their cousin was going to become the next IAF chief. At that time, the Defence Ministry was looking at various companies for choppers to ferry VVIPs to heights of up to 6000m.</p>
<p>The Tyagi brothers allegedly got in touch with Guido Haschke even before their cousin became Air Chief Marshal and asked him to find a company that could provide choppers and would be willing to deal with them. It was then that Haschke brought in AgustaWestland and the brothers influenced Tyagi and others, allegedly through bribes, to alter specifications in a way that would make Agusta the only company to qualify.</p>

(File Photo)
<p>Protesting ex-servicemen tonight suspended their 320-day-old agitation for complete implementation of One Rank One Pension (OROP) as senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani assured them of leading their legal battle in the apex court.</p>
<p>&#8220;The indefinite relay fast has been suspended now as we will be taking the legal recourse. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had said that proverbial gun was been held to the head of the government by virtue of our presence at Jantar Mantar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that we have suspended the agitation, we believe that Parrikar will now keep his promises made to us,&#8221; said Col (retd) Anil Kaul, spokesperson of the ex-servicemen movement.</p>

<p>Addressing armed forces veterans staging protest at Jantar Mantar in the national capital, Jethmalani said he would fight their case in the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am 93-year-old and I can die any day but I assure you that it will not happen before I get you justice from the Supreme Court,&#8221; Jethmalani said.</p>
<p>Major General (retd) Satbir Singh, leader of the protesting veterans, claimed a case will be filed by Jethmalani on OROP demand in the Supreme Court in next 3-4 days and he will not charge any fee.</p>
<p>He said four more cases have been filed in the armed forces tribunal.</p>
<p>&#8220;These cases pertain to rulings for jawans, war widows, arrears since 2006, payments for honorary ranks, rounding off of disability pension, and payments of reservists,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The veterans&#8217; protest at Jantar Mantar entered its 320th day today.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had in September last year announced implementation of the long delayed OROP for ex-servicemen but the veterans have been continuing with their protest demanding &#8220;complete&#8221; implementation of the scheme.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2776969" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/modi-mask-759.jpg" alt="narendra modi, Chhau mask, narendra modi Chhau mask, Milkha Singh, saman khan, Olympics, Olympics ambassador, Vijay Mallya, india news" /> Jamshedpur: Prime Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> (C) holds traditional Chou headgear during the launch of &#8216;Gramuday Se Bharat Uday Abhiyan&#8217; in Jamshedpur on Sunday.

<p>Over a decade after the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government tripped over India Shining, the fabled mukhota is back in the limelight. But now, after the current prime minister helped to give the finishing touches to the prime ministerial waxwork, something extraordinary was required. The PM rose to the occasion wearing an expressionless Chhau mask, unnerving both the faithful and the rest, and inviting a bit of mockery too.</p>
<p>Actually, a week of relentless mockery is closing with a sense of delicate balance. Donald Trump mocked an Indian call centre employee without mocking India. Milkha Singh mocked the choice of <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/salman-khan/">Salman Khan</a> as ambassador to the Olympics without mocking Salman Khan. And Vijay Mallya mocked everyone by telling the Financial Times (the video ran on NDTV in India) that he wanted “to close a painful chapter” in an otherwise scintillating business career. He also declared that the Indian government could have his passport or his money, but not both.</p>
<p>The media forever fear disruptive change, but it never really happens. For instance, Aaj Tak’s morning bulletin, which runs 100 stories from 100 towns, has taken over the mantle of the lurid crime pages which vanished from the newspapers decades ago. The programme is a non-stop, rapid-fire assault by news about road rage, road fatalities, murder, suicide, rape, breach of promise, arson, forest fires, pillage, petty vendetta, and random, low-down caste violence. (A sober version, with 50 stories in 10 minutes, follows) However, some of the most interesting stories from the small towns, which would merit only two column centimetres in the briefs columns of the newspapers, if at all, get full play amidst this mayhem. Kipling would have loved them. This week, there was news of Jaipur’s citizens stopping traffic to protest against the depredations of monkeys, and elephants getting drunk and disorderly in villages after snagging some really happening mahua.</p>

<p>Over the years, an urban legend had gained currency about African elephants deliberately letting fruit rot, with the premeditated intention of getting tight. In 2005, National Geographic news reported that it had been put to rest on rational and scientific grounds by a spoilsport at the US Fish and Wildlife Service. But the Indian elephant has clearly cut to the chase, bypassing the fermentation stage and going straight for the bottle.</p>
<p>This week, the National Geographic struck a raw nerve in Delhi, which it celebrated as the “home to unbreathable air and undrinkable water”. It’s the same old story, garnished with the mandatory quote from Sunita Narain of the Centre for Science and Environment, but Matthieu Paley’s pictures are giving the willies to even hardened citizens of the capital. Some images are as predictable as the story, like that of a ragpicker on the slopes of the magic mountain of trash, eternally smouldering Bhalswa. But there’s also this little snap of a Noida settlement on the bank of an old waterway which has become an open sewer. I drive past it on my way to work but even so, the picture of people living like that is unnerving and shaming. But then, a tributary of that sewer runs near my own apartment, though it is a better part of town. The filth is right in our midst, and we would see it every day if we didn’t have tunnel vision. But if we actually saw things as they are, we would all go mad.</p>
<p>Images of public disaffection continue to dominate television screens. “Den of organised sex racket” — that epically awful phrase in the JNU probe report, which has rekindled the controversy, has brought images of anti-nationals conducting torchlit marches on the campus. Further away, Kabir Khan, director of Bajrangi Bhaijaan, was surrounded by a group of enraged people at Karachi airport. Just some guys shouting “Pakistan zindabad” and “shame, shame”. No big deal but definitely anti-national. But not half as anti-national as those guys marching at JNU, which the government would have declared enemy territory if it were legally possible.</p>

(file photo)
<p>Leader of Opposition in Kerala Assembly, V S Achuthanandan, a leading crowd puller of the CPI(M)&#8217;s Assembly election rallies, on Friday stunned party workers by making only a one line speech in Poonjar segment while campaigning for a LDF candidate and not uttering a single word against former government chief whip P C George who is contesting as an independent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cast your vote for (LDF candidate) P C Joseph who is contesting as the LDF candidate to put an end to Oommen Chandy&#8217;s corrupt rule,&#8221; said Achuthanandan ending his one line speech.</p>
<p>When his attention was drawn to the presence of LDF candidate from Peermade, E S Bijimol on the dais, the 93-year-old CPI(M) leader also appealed to the people to cast their votes for the CPI nominee.</p>

<p>A mass rally was organised by the LDF in Poonjar and supporters expected that Achuthanandan would come down heavily on former government chief whip P C George, who is contesting as an independent after LDF refused to accept him in its fold.</p>
<p>He, however, did not utter a single word against George, who had earlier said his support goes to Achuthanandan as Chief Ministerial candidate of the LDF.</p>
<p>George was quick to comment, saying the one line speech is a clear message to the people of Poonjar that he enjoys moral support of the CPI(M) veteran in the key constituency which is witnessing a tight four-cornered struggle with UDF&#8217;s Georgekutty Augusthy of KC(M) and BDJS nominee M R Ullas also in the fray.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, addressing another election rally in Pala, the constituency of KC(M) supremo K M Mani, Achuthanandan attacked the former state Finance Minister, saying he is &#8220;a gentleman who is hated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Special CBI judge Bharat Parashar said it would hear on May 11 the plea of accused Suresh Singhal, also director of New Delhi Exim Pvt Ltd, who had moved an application on April 21 seeking pardon and to make disclosure statement in the case.</p>

<p>During the day, the special court ordered framing of charges against Jindal, former Minister of State for Coal Dasari Narayan Rao, ex-Jharkhand CM Madhu Koda and 12 others for criminal conspiracy, cheating and other offences in Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block allocation scam case.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the over all facts and circumstances of the case, I however direct that for the time being copy of applications moved by Suresh Singhal along with the order sheets recorded by the court may be supplied to counsel for accused persons as it will be appropriate to first adjudicate upon the present issue before proceeding to frame charges formally against the accused persons,&#8221; the judge, who has already issued notice to CBI and 14 other accused, said.</p>
<p>In his plea, Singhal has claimed that co-accused Rajeev Jain, Director of Jindal Realty Pvt Ltd, had purchased NDEPL at the instruction of Sushil Maroo also working with the Naveen Jindal Group.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was also in practice of selling companies. Rajeev Jain had been purchasing different types of companies from me. I also sold New Delhi Exim Pvt Ltd to him. I also handed over all the papers required by him for the purpose of transfer of ownership and management, documentary evidence of which forms part of the records&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rajeev Jain in conspiracy with Maroo kept me in dark and didn&#8217;t disclose their real purpose. After getting all the transfer papers from me they kept the shares and directors change pending taking the advantage of my good faith which I had for them,&#8221; he claimed.</p>
<p>He further claimed that decision to invest and pay Rs 2 crore to Sowbhagya Media Ltd, allegedly promoted by co-accused and former Minister of State for Coal Dasari Narayana Rao, was carried out at their behest.</p>
<p>&#8220;After 3-4 days they (Jain and Maroo) again approached me to execute a specific transaction i.e payment of Rs 2 crores to Sowbhagya Media Ltd. I advised them to get the same at their end. As the directors were not changed at that time and similarly bank signatories were also not changed, I was again requested to get the same done at my end&#8230;,&#8221; he alleged.</p>
<p>&#8220;As there were no grounds to doubt, I simply relied and issued the cheques without any intention of financial benefit. So this has not been my decision to invest with Sowbhagya Media Ltd. In fact this has been the decision taken by Sushil Maroo and at his instruction executed by Rajeev Jain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sushil Maroo instructed Jain in my presence to execute the transaction of the subject payment of Rs 2 crores. I only came to know about the real nature of payment at a very later stage. Despite my repeated requests, the directorship and shareholding was not changed by Jain and Maroo. And thereafter I was forced to keep my mouth shut otherwise I may face dire consequences,&#8221; Singhal claimed in his plea.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2776860&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned former IAF chief S P Tyagi in connection with its money laundering probe in the Rs 3,600 crore AgustaWestland VVIP choppers deal case.</p>
<p>This is the first time that the ex-Chief Of Staff of the Indian Air Force has been summoned by the central agency.</p>
<p>Official sources said the summons to Tyagi have been issued under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).</p>
<p>While the exact date when Tyagi is supposed to appear before the Investigating Officer (IO) of the case here has been kept under wraps, it is understood he has been asked to come &#8220;in person&#8221; in the next week.</p>

<p>CBI has questioned Tyagi earlier in the same case and he had then denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Sources indicated Tyagi&#8217;s questioning is necessary in the light of a recent judgement of a Milan (Italy) court which had sentenced Italian defence and aerospace major Finmeccanica&#8217;s former chief Giuseppe Orsi and the former CEO of the firm Bruno Spagnolini on corruption charges in the sale of a dozen AgustaWestland helicopters to India for VVIP purposes.</p>
<p>The allegation against the former Air chief is that he allegedly reduced the height of the VVIP helicopters so that AgustaWestland could be included in the bids.</p>
<p>He took over as the Indian Air Force chief on December 31, 2005 and retired from service in 2007. ED had registered a PMLA case in this regard in 2014 and named 21 people including Tyagi in its money laundering FIR.</p>
<p>It had also arrested Delhi-based businessman Gautam Khaitan and had also filed a charge sheet last year.</p>
<p>ED is probing the case in which 70 million Euros (about Rs 360 crore) were allegedly paid as kickbacks.</p>
<p>The agency had earlier submitted that Khaitan was on the board of Chandigarh-based company Aeromatrix which was allegedly a front firm for the financial dealings in the chopper deal.</p>
<p>On January 1, 2014, India scrapped the contract with Finmeccanica&#8217;s British subsidiary AgustaWestland for supplying 12 AW101 VVIP choppers to the Indian Air Force (IAF) over alleged breach of contractual obligations and charges of paying kickbacks to the tune of Rs 423 crore by it for securing the deal.</p>
<p>In view of the corruption charges, India has also barred Finmeccanica and its group companies from participating in any new programme of the defence ministry.</p>
<p>The central agency has also issued Letters Rogatory (judicial requests) to ten countries in this case.</p>

<p>“We were looking for them, when we got call from the parents of one of the missing child. He informed that all of them had reached a wedding in Bhurkunda area on Wednesday and they were safe. Friday morning, our team reached there and brought four of the boys back. One of the boys was taken to his home by his parents. They were safe and no physical harm was done to them,” said Social Welfare Officer (Ramgarh), Monica Rani Tooti. She, however, said that she was yet to talk to them in detail.</p>

<p>Child Development Officer (Chitarpur Block), Reena Kumari, said: “On Wednesday, they had gone to bathe at a well near the school. It appears that there they decided to leave for the wedding thinking that the school authorities would not allow them to go to the wedding. They then sneaked away without informing the school authorities. We are talking to them in more detail to ascertain whether they had applied for leave at all.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2776766&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Source: ANI)
<p>Raging forest fires in Uttarakhad have killed five people and blighted 1890.79 hectares of forest land in Kumaon and Garhwal regions prompting Governor K K Paul to seek deployment of three NDRF companies to douse the flame and conduct rescue operations.</p>
<p>Since early February, 922 cases of forest fire incidents in the state have occurred killing five people, including three women and a child in separate incidents, and injuring seven, Principal Conservator of Forest (PCF) B P Gupta said.</p>
<p>Pauri, Tehri and Nainital are the worst hit by these fires as they abound in Cheed and Sal trees which are highly inflammable. &#8220;The NDRF companies, assisted by experts, will launch fire extinguishing and rescue operations in affected areas immediately,&#8221; Chief Secretary Shatrughna Singh said, adding precaution is a must to minimise loss to forest wealth and wildlife.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="http://twitter.com/hashtag/WATCH?src=hash">#WATCH</a>: Fire across 1600 ha of forest area in Uttarakhand,1500 villages in Kumaon &amp; Garhwal division under threat.<a href="http://t.co/qEGUfurup1">http://t.co/qEGUfurup1</a></p>
<p>— ANI (@ANI_news) <a href="http://twitter.com/ANI_news/status/725977531677962240">April 29, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p>IG Sanjay Gunjyal has been asked to coordinate with the NDRF, the district magistrates concerned and Principal Conservator of Forest to supervise the rescue operations, he said. Locals have being told to report a fire incident to the district magistrate concerned as soon as they sight it so that it can bee controlled in time. &#8220;Uttarakhand Governor KK Paul convened an important meeting of officials concerned last evening to review the steps being taken to control the forest fires spreading to residential areas,&#8221; Gupta, who is also the nodal officer for fire incidents in Kumaon and Garhwal regions, said.</p>
<p>The governor has doubled the number of personnel deployed from 3000 to 6000 to control the fire and asked all agencies including the SDRF, district administration and the rural population to contribute their bit, he said. Forest fires are natural during summer but this time they have occurred on a bigger scale as the fire season which normally begins by February 15 began on February 2 when two women were charred to death in the jungles of Uttarkashi, the PCF said.</p>
<p>The other three casualties including that of a woman and her six year old child were reported from Nainital and Pauri districts, he said. The PCF said the scale of forest fires in Uttarakhand this time has been bigger due to little or no rain during winter at most places.</p>
<p>Pre-fire alerts listing possible fire points over the next seven days in forest areas are being made available in the Forest Department website <a href="http://www.forest.uk.govt" rel="nofollow">http://www.forest.uk.govt</a>. Former chief minister Harish Rawat has asked the governor to declare Uttarakhand as fire-disaster stricken state and involve locals in fire extinguishing efforts.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2776785&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2776780" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/draupadi-murmu-jharkhand-go.jpg" alt="Jharkhand, jharkhand domicile, jharkhand domicile issue, jharkhand governor domicile issue, Draupadi Murmu, domicile definition, jharkhand tribal domicile, jharkhand govt jobs domicile, jharkhand news, india news, latest news" width="759" height="422" />Four <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> MPs have written a letter to Jharkhad Governor Draupadi Murmu seeking her intervention in rectifying ‘several mistakes’ in the definition of domicile announced by the state government.</p>
<p>The MPs have said that dissatisfaction among people was increasing due to the mistakes and they needed to be rectified at the earliest.</p>
<p>The Raghubar Das government had cleared the definition of ‘domicile’ in a meeting of the cabinet held on April 7. However, a formal notification for the same is yet to be made. Opposition parties have already cried foul play over the definition and threatened mass agitation.</p>
<p>The letter was written by Ranchi MP Ram Tahal Chaudhary and signed by Jamshedpur MP Bidyut Baran Mahato, Khunti MP and senior BJP leader Kariya Munda and Singhbhum MP Lakshman Gilua, a member of the Scheduled Tribe. It was sent to the Governor on Thursday.</p>

<p>The letter read: “The move to define a domicile is appreciable. However, dissatisfaction among people is increasing as the opposition parties and several other groups have been demanding changes in the definition.”</p>
<p>Specifically, the letter pointed out, there should be clarity on how the interests of the tribal and the ‘moolvasis (sons of the soil)’ would be protected.</p>
<p>“The clause reserving group III and IV government jobs for the ‘local’ should clearly mention that it would be reserved only for the tribal and moolvasis,” the letter said.</p>
<p>Besides, the cut-off date of 1985 (for the clause which says that anybody residing in Jharkhand for business or jobs, and having acquired immovable properties, for 30 years or more would be considered a ‘local), should be fixed for all times, the letter said.</p>
<p>Further, the letter also sought to have a clause for such outsiders, using the 30-year clause, to get a no-objection certificate (NOC) from their parent state before they are given a domicile certificate. “Many people use domicile facilities from both the states. This should be curbed by having a provision for NOC from their parent state,” the letter said.</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> over phone, Tahal Chaudhary said: “Our intention is simple. Every day, there are various interpretations coming in the media. People are getting confused. The tribal are not happy. The purpose for writing this letter is to get the government to clarify all these finer points so that the issues are settled.”</p>
<p>Chaudhary added that a day before announcing the policy, Chief Minister Das had met him and other leaders and informed them that the government was going to clear the ‘definition’ the next day.</p>
<p>Munda said over phone: “Obviously, there is resentment among people. Otherwise, there would have been no need to write the letter. We are clear that, out of the six definitions, the last three are confusing and do not adequately safeguard the interests of the tribal and the moolvasis.”</p>
<p>Munda further added, the government has not come out with a formal documentation yet. “Actually, I am not in a position to deeply analyse the whole thing, as the government has not come up with any formal document. Most of what we have pointed out is on the basis of the media reports. However, it is true that I am opposed to many of the clauses right from the day it was announced,” said Munda. He added that he last interacted with Das on the issue long back, when he had just become the chief minister.</p>
<p>While Gilua could not be reached for his comment, Mahato did not share his view saying he was busy.</p>

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]
<p>On April 7, the cabinet had cleared the definition of ‘domicile’ using criteria like – land records on the basis of the last survey done; identification by the gram pradhan on the basis of language and cultural practices being followed by the person (for the landless); those who have stayed in Jharkhand for 30 years or more on account of business and jobs, and have acquired immovable properties; the persons employed by Jharkhand or Central governments (and their children and spouses); and those holding constitutional posts in the state. The state had separately reserved group III and IV jobs for the ‘local’. This was done for the first time after the state came into being in 2000.</p>

<p>Actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha on Friday said if approached he would be happy to promote Bihar as its brand ambassador.</p>
<p>There are reports that the state is considering to rope in some Bollywood celebrity as its face. Sinha, however, said nothing is official yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing official about it so far. But, if and when I am considered for the responsibility of brand ambassador by dear friend Nitish Kumar, I would lend my services for furthering cause of my home state as my duty as &#8216;dhartiputra&#8217; (son of soil),&#8221; Sinha told PTI.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be no demand or command from my side for this (if chosen as brand ambassador of Bihar),&#8221; Sinha, popularly known as &#8220;Bihari Babu&#8221;, said over phone from Jaipur.</p>
<p>The second term <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/">Lok Sabha</a> member from Patna Sahib praised Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and addressed him as his &#8220;younger brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chief Minister Nitish Kumar through his able leadership and &#8216;sushasan&#8217; (good governance) has brought Bihar on the forefront of the nation&#8230; Nitish deserves kudos for all the hard work he has done for the state,&#8221; Sinha added.</p>
<p>The actor-politician has caused furore in political circles many times by warmly meeting with the CM and praising him notwithstanding hostility against Kumar by his partymen.</p>
<p>Earlier, while launching Sinha&#8217;s biography &#8220;Anything but Khamosh&#8221;, Kumar had described Sinha as &#8220;pride of Bihar&#8221; and had sought his service to develop film and culture in the state.</p>
<p>There are reports that the state Tourism department is also considering the names of actress and MP Rekha and noted scriptwriter Javed Akhtar as brand ambassador.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2776533&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Source:  Express Archives)
<p>Bringing an end to more than a decade-old controversy over Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society in Mumbai, the Bombay High Court on Friday ordered the demolition of the 31-storey building.</p>
<p>The Adarsh scam, first reported by <a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> in 2003, saw several former army chiefs, bureaucrats, politicians and ministers embroiled in the controversy over allegations that rules were bent to acquire land and build apartments that were originally meant to house Kargil war heroes and widows.</p>
<p>Conceived as a six storey structure, Adarsh was accorded additional Floor Space Index, taking the total number of flats to 102.</p>

<p><strong>Here, we take a brief look at the Express exclusives on Adarsh scam: </strong></p>
<p><em>Nov 03, 2010:</em> <a href="http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/man-who-cleared-31st-floor-is-father-of-adarsh-allottee/705826/0" target="_blank">Man who cleared 31st floor is father of Adarsh allottee</a></p>
<p>The controversial Adarsh Housing Society in Mumbai&#8217;s Cuffe Parade allowed to use a portion of its Floor Space Index (FSI) to construct 10 extra apartments instead of setting it aside for recreational grounds as required by the rules.</p>
<p>Moreover, an extra floor — the top-most (31st) — that was constructed to use this FSI was built without the mandatory clearance of the High Rise Committee of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), as its then Commissioner, Jairaj Phatak, decided that there was no need for Adarsh to obtain a fresh No Objection Certificate (NOC), documents with The Indian Express show.</p>
<p>Phatak&#8217;s son Kanishka is among the 103 members who own an apartment in Adarsh.</p>
<p><em>November 4, 2010:</em> <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/in-oct-defence-audit-questioned-allotment-of-land-to-highrise/" target="_blank">In Oct, defence audit questioned allotment of land to highrise</a></p>
<p>An internal defence audit had slammed defence officials in Mumbai for their alleged omissions and violations in allowing defence land to be used for the construction of the controversial Adarsh Co-operative Housing Society in Cuffe Parade. The audit report also asked what action had been taken to reclaim the land that was allotted to Adarsh.</p>
<p><em>November 5, 2010:</em> <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/earns-rs-8-600-per-month-owns-rs-5cr-flat-2/" target="_blank">Earns Rs 8,600 per month, owns Rs 5-cr flat</a></p>
<p>Investigations by The Indian Express have found that the 103 members in the 31-storey building include a driver employed in a Nagpur-based infrastructure company, whose Managing Director is a Special Invitee to the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a>s National Executive Committee.</p>
<p>The name of the driver, Sudhakar Laxman Madke, 50, appears in the 2003 membership list of Adarsh alongside that of his employers: Abhay H Sancheti, Chairman of SMS Infrastructure Ltd; Vice-Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Sancheti; and Joint Managing Director Anand S Sancheti. The 43-year-old firm is one of the largest infrastructure firms in central India and is involved in the construction of highways, railways, dams and in coal mining.</p>
<p><em>November 10, 2010</em> <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/neta-has-to-go-but-babus-sit-pretty-in-their-adarsh-flats/" target="_blank">Neta has to go but babus sit pretty in their Adarsh flats</a></p>
<p>Allegations against bureaucrats, many of them senior IAS officers, have particularly been glaring in the Adarsh scandal as many of them are accused of clearing files and allowing laws to be violated in return for an apartment in the 31-storey tower in their name or in the name of their relatives.</p>
<p>The Indian Express investigates and lists some of the key bureaucrats whose names have been caught in the controversy: Ramanand Tiwari, PV Deshmukh, Jairaj Phatak, Pradeep Vyas, Idzes Angmo Kundan, Uttam Khobragade, DK Sankaran, Subash Lala, CS Sangitrao, Arun Pawar.</p>
<p><em>November 11, 2010:</em> <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/cbi-probing-adarsh-members-for-six-months/" target="_blank">CBI probing Adarsh members for six months</a></p>
<p>Ashok Chavan may have been forced to quit within weeks of his name being linked to the alleged shady dealings involving the Adarsh Housing Society but the CBI has been probing the members of the group for almost six months now, suspecting some of them to be proxy owners. The investigation was launched into the source of income of the defence officers and Central employees who own apartments in their name or in the name of their relatives after some defence officials, who had apparently been denied flats, circulated letters and raised a stink about the tower.</p>

<p>Following controversy over a book, part of DU&#8217;s history curriculum, which refers to Bhagat Singh as a &#8220;revolutionary terrorist&#8221;, the university today decided to stop the sale and distribution of its Hindi translation.</p>
<p>The book titled &#8220;India&#8217;s Struggle for Independence&#8221;, which has been part of DU&#8217;s curriculum for over two decades mentions Bhagat Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Surya Sen and others as &#8220;revolutionary terrorists&#8221; in Chapter 20. It also calls the Chittagong movement a &#8220;terrorist act&#8221;, while killing of British police officer John Sanders has been called an &#8220;act of terrorism&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Hindi version &#8220;Bharat ka swantrata sangharsh&#8221; was published by DU&#8217;s Directorate of Hindi Medium Implementation in 1990. &#8220;The sale and distribution of the book &#8216;Bharat ka swantrata sangharsh&#8217; authored by Bipan Chandra, Mridula Mukherjee, Aditya Mukherjee, Sucheta Mahajan and KN Panikkar and published by DU has been stopped,&#8221; university spokesperson Malay Neerav said.</p>

<p>The decision came after the freedom fighter&#8217;s family had objected to the usage of word and had written a letter to HRD Minister <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/politician/smriti-irani/">Smriti Irani</a> demanding appropriate changes in the book. His kin had also met DU Vice Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi regarding the issue.</p>
<p>Irani who had termed the text of the book to be an &#8220;academic murder of sacrifices of individuals&#8221;, had directed the HRD officials to ask the university to &#8220;reconsider&#8221; it. &#8220;We wrote to DU two days ago stating that connotation, use of word terrorist is not a mark of respect. We have also implored, since DU is an autonomous institution, to reconsider the use of this word,&#8221; Irani told reporters. The university authorities maintained that they had no control over sale and distribution of the English version of the book as it was not published by DU. They also asserted that the book was a &#8220;reference book&#8221; and not a &#8220;text book&#8221;.</p>

<p>The book&#8217;s publisher Penguin had yesterday issued a statement saying it was working with the authors for a revised edition of the book. &#8220;Language has evolved since the book was first published (1988) and we are already working with the co-authors to update and revise the phraseology to reflect both modern usage and the hugely important role Bhagat Singh played in the creation of modern India,&#8221; the publisher had said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2776673&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>“A direct road from Tawang to Guwahati through Bhutan will most importantly by-pass Sela Pass that often gets blocked due to heavy snow cover during the winter months and landslides in rainy season. It will cut down travel time by about six hours and increase socio-economic activities between Bhutan and Northeastern India,” Pul said while interacting with Jaideep Sarkar, Indian ambassador to Bhutan who called on him in Itanagar on Friday.</p>

<p>Development of this route via Tashigang in Bhutan and Darranga in Assam would enable agriculture and horticulture export from Lumla sub-division, along with the newly created Bongkhar circle of Tawang district, the chief minister said. While it requires construction of only a 15-km stretch between Lumla in Tawang and Tashigang in Bhutan, once operational, it will cut down travel distance between Tawang and Guwahati by almost 200 kms.</p>
<p>While the distance between Tawang and Guwahati via Tezpur is only 503 kms, the sharp gradients and elevation between Bhalukpong and Tawang makes it one of the most challenging roads in the Himalayas. Sela Pass, which is about 60 kms short of Tawang on the other hand is the most difficult stretch at an elevation of 4170 metres.</p>
<p>“Arunachal and Bhutan share more than just a border. We also share cultural and religious histories, particularly the communities living in Tawang and West Kameng,” Pul said. The chief minister also suggested creation of a Bhutan-Arunachal circuit in order to increase tourist inflow to Arunachal Pradesh directly through the Himalayan kingdom with which it shares 160 km international boundary.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2776584&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Calcutta High Court on Friday directed CFSL Hyderabad to ascertain whether the Narada tapes and devices used to record an alleged sting operation against Trinamool <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> leaders are genuine or not.</p>
<p>A division bench comprising Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice A Banerjee ordered the director of Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory at Hyderabad to make preliminary inquiry to find out whether the devices used in the &#8216;sting&#8217; and the recordings are tampered, engineered, doctored or genuine.</p>
<p>It directed the CFSL to complete the analysis within four weeks of being given the recordings and devices &#8212; an iPhone, a laptop and a pen drive in which the recordings are stored. The court observed that as a preliminary step it has to first ascertain whether the devices are tampered, engineered, doctored or genuine.</p>

<p>The purported recordings, which were released by Narada News a few days after elections to the West Bengal Assembly were announced, show Trinamool Congress MPs and state ministers allegedly taking money. The court said that as per Narada News editor-in-chief Mathew Samuel&#8217;s affidavit, the alleged sting was recorded on iPhone, the recordings were then transferred to a laptop and then the recordings were transferred to a pen drive.</p>
<p>Noting that Samuel had handed over the iPhone and pen drive to a court-appointed three-member committee but not the laptop, the bench directed him to go to Hyderabad and hand over the laptop to the CFSL director within a week. The bench directed the high court registrar (original side), who is the chairman of the committee, to personally hand over the iPhone and pen drive to the CFSL director. It further directed that the report of the analysis should be kept confidential by CFSL and that it shall be collected by the chairman of the committee personally and placed before the court.</p>
<p>The bench noted that Samuel had put a condition that the cost of laptop be deposited before handing it over and observed that Samuel was the person who initiated the matter and as such cannot put conditions while directing him to go and hand over the laptop to CFSL director.</p>
<p>Passing the order, the division bench said all contentions, including the question of maintainability of the PIL, were being kept open. The court said at this stage it was not dealing with the merits of the petition, which had prayed for a forensic analysis of the recordings and the devices to prove genuineness and a subsequent investigation by an independent agency.</p>
<p>Stressing the sensitivity of the matter, the court observed that it would speak volumes if the information was genuine and would also speaks volumes if the information was not genuine as it involved the confidence of the common man in the system.</p>
<p>The court observed that despite opposition from some of the respondents in the matter, it felt that an analysis can be done at this stage in the light of verdicts of the Supreme Court which indicated the categories of cases where preliminary enquiry can be done.</p>
<p>Counsels for some of the respondents, who were purportedly shown receiving money in the recordings, submitted before the court that Samuel had refused to come down to Kolkata to hand over the recordings and the device to the court citing personal security concerns.</p>
<p>However, they pointed out, he came over to the city and held a press conference a few days after the recordings and the device were secured from him by a court -appointed committee in New Delhi. The matter would appear before the court after the forensic analysis reports are submitted before it.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2776548&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2776440 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/adarsh-l.jpg" alt="Adarsh, Adarsh scam, adarsh demolition" width="759" height="422" /></p>
<p><em><strong>The story below was the first report on the Adarsh Housing Society scam, <a href="http://archive.indianexpress.com/oldStory/28841/">published in The Indian Express on August 3, 2003</a>. </strong></em></p>
<p>What might the chief of naval staff, a Shiv Sena MLC, a promoter under CBI investigation, IAS officers, a local army commander and ‘Kargil Heroes’ have in common?</p>
<p>The desire to get a flat in one of India’s costliest swathe of real estate at the tip of south Mumbai, Cuffe Parade, where two-bedroom flats can cost you upto Rs 2 crore.</p>
<p>Over-riding opposition from the Ministry of Defence, the Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society, with 71 members, aims to rip up more than 100 trees of the lush Kukri Ecopark on a controversial bit of super-prime land—a little less than an acre valued at Rs 34 crore—abutting critical army and navy defence establishments.</p>
<p><strong>AWOL IN DELHI, COFFEE IN MUMBAI</strong></p>
<p>Thakur is under CBI investigation in a 1998 deal where he allegedly allowed construction on defence land in return for two flats in Nagpur. Thakur said the search for the land began in 1994. The society got land elsewhere in Colaba but it was cancelled after coastal zoning regulations. Then their attention turned to Cuffe Parade.</p>
<p>And how can the lone JCO on the list, Subedar Ramnarain Achelal Thakur, ‘‘Kargil Hero’’, ever hope to deposit Rs 6 lakh as 20 per cent advance payment once all clearances come through?</p>
<p>‘‘You see, jawans have ancestral lands. They can sell them easily,’’ said Thakur. And then subedar Thakur will collect his family from Bihar, he explained, and translocate them to Cuffe Parade.</p>
<p><strong>WHO WANTS A FLAT IN CUFFE PARADE? </strong></p>
<p>Some of the 71 members of the Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society:</p>
<p>• Admiral Madhavendra Singh Bhagwat Singh, Chief of Naval Staff uRear Admiral Raman Prem Suthan, Fleet Commander, Eastern Fleet</p>
<p>• Lt Gen Gurbaksh Singh Shiv Singh Sihota, GOC, Southern Command</p>
<p>• Major General T K Kaul, GOC, Maharastra and Gujarat Area</p>
<p>• Maj Gen Varinder Singh, former GOC, Maharashtra and Gujarat Area</p>
<p>• Ramchandra Sonelal Thakur, Subdivisional officer, Defence Estates</p>
<p>• Subedar Ramnarain Achelal Thakur, ‘‘Kargil Hero’’</p>
<p>• Major Rajiv Kumar Hitnarain Singh, ‘‘Kargil Hero’’</p>
<p>• Kanhaiyalal V Gidwani, MLC, Shiv Sena, Mamta Kanade, wife of senior IAS officer Ramesh Kanade</p>
<p>• P V Deshmukh, deputy secretary, urban development department</p>
<p>‘‘Since land is a state subject and we cannot interfere directly, we have requested them to reconsider,’’ Director General of the Defence Estates Agency Veena Maitra told The Sunday Express. ‘‘We hope the state will listen to reason.’’</p>
<p>That isn’t happening, primarily because the Adarsh Society is simply not what it claims to be: a housing service for defence personnel.</p>
<p>Its chief promoter is Ramchandra Sonelal Thakur, a junior officer with the Defence Estates agency and who is under CBI scrutiny for allegedly allowing construction on defence land in 1998 in return for two flats in Nagpur.</p>
<p>Says Thakur: ‘‘It (the Adarsh society) is for a noble cause&#8230;It’s a cooperative movement and those who don’t get membership are obviously disgruntled&#8230;Adarsh is only concerned with the military, all branches of defence forces.’’</p>
<p>But The Sunday Express investigation threw up names of at least six relatives of senior Maharashtra IAS officers. And what’s a Shiv Sena MLC, Kanhaiyalal V Gidwani, doing as the joint secretary of the society?</p>
<p>‘‘Well you know how government is, someone has to help us in dealing with them,’’ Thakur said.</p>
<p>When contacted, Gidwani—there are three Gidwanis in the list—said, ‘‘If we can help good military people, that’s fine.’’ Asked about his presence in the society, the MLC declared he had a ‘‘rightful’’ place in Adarsh Society.</p>
<p>‘‘As members of the legislative council we have some rights,’’ he said. ‘‘We have only helped them with government work.’’</p>
<p>In Mantralay, the seat of Maharashtra’s government, the Adarsh Society’s saga is known for its high stakes and low machinations. The allotment of the land was cleared by the chief minister himself, as are all vacant plots in land-starved Mumbai.</p>
<p>When contacted, Chief Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said: ‘‘I will comment later.’’ However, he did not take calls later and got his official spokesman to say that ‘‘the decision to allot the plot was not taken by Shindesaheb. It might have been taken by his predecessor (Vilasrao Deshmukh).’’</p>
<p>The spokesman said the revenue department—the authority to actually allot the plot—hasn’t yet formally handed over the plot to the society. ‘‘However, the chief minister has said he would look into the case.’’</p>
<p>When and how that will happen isn’t clear but society officials continue to plug a dubious list. For example, Gidwani insists there isn’t ‘‘a single IAS officer’’ in the list and then admits: ‘‘Politically involved people are there&#8230;Otherwise how can they get such prime land?’’</p>
<p>The local army commander, Major General T N Kaul (head of the Maharashtra and Gujarat area) did not answer calls or faxed queries about the land. Incidentally, Gen Kaul, too, is a member of the society.</p>
<p>Another member, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Madhavendra Singh, said he would inform Naval Headquarters when a flat was allotted to him. However, he added: ‘‘I had absolutely no idea about the background of the person who is promoting it (the society).’’</p>
<p>The Ecopark was inaugurated in 1996 by Maj Gen B A Cariappa, then local army commander, but the army, not known to give up land without a fight, even overruled its own estate agency, which pointed out</p>
<p>that the Army, Navy and Air Force are chronically short of land in Mumbai.</p>
<p>The Ecopark came up on reclaimed land and because the land-use pattern was changed (through notifications) it was freed up for residential use, the promoters insist. Defence ministry officials now question that change.</p>
<p>Pradeep Vyas, Mumbai Collector, acknowledged the objections, but no more. ‘‘It is state land, we have all the documents,’’ said Vyas.</p>
<p>Indeed, on April 5, 2000, a letter addressed to the collector from the army’s Maharashtra and Gujarat Area headquarters said the land fell outside the defence boundary, but added: ‘‘Necessary action at your end may be taken as deemed fit for the welfare of service personnel/ex-servicemen/their wives.’’</p>
<p>In January 2003, a letter of intent was issued to the society, which now has to comply with application formalities—providing affidavits about income, occupation—before construction is permitted.</p>
<p>On what basis then was this housing society given the land? ‘‘That,’’ said Vyas, ‘‘is something you should address to the government.’’</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in Delhi, Thakur’s boss in the Defence Estates Office is fuming because he’s missing from office after being denied leave. ‘‘We are going to proceed against him for this,’’says Maitra. As for his CBI record, she’s waiting for them to finish the inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jha Commission report should be made public as oustees of the Sardar Sarvor dam have not been rehabilitated yet. Madhya Pradesh government is sitting tight on the report and not taking any action against the corrupt officers who had siphoned off huge money meant for rehabilitation,&#8221; the activist told reporters.</p>
<p>She said that around 50,000 people displaced by the project have yet to be rehabilitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;But water level of the Sardar Sarvor dam is increased further, which will spell a doom for the people living in the catchment area,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Jha Commission was set up by the Madhya Pradesh High Court on August 21, 2008 to probe allegations of over 3000 fake land sale registries, corruption in rehabilitation sites, issuance of livelihood grants, allotment of plots for construction of houses to oustees of the project in Alirajpur, Dhar, Khargone and Barwani districts of Madhya Pradesh.</p>
<p>Sardar Sarvor dam is built in Gujarat on river Narmada which originates from MP.</p>

<p>India should talk to Pakistan as well as China to resolve the Siachen issue which is a humanitarian matter as soldiers are dying there, JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav said in Rajya Sabha on Friday.</p>
<p>Raising the issue during the Zero Hour, Yadav noted that recently 10 solders were buried under the ice after an avalanche hit a military post in Siachen, the highest battlefield in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;This area is difficult to live. So far around 882 jawans have died there. It&#8217;s not just an issue of India, but also of Pakistan and China. It is a human issue. Their jawans also face the same fate,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Earlier also we spoke to Pakistan over this (Siachen) issue and some solution was reached, but it went back to the old situation as both the countries do not trust each other,&#8221; Yadav said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to say whenever there are talks between India and Pakistan in the future&#8230; So I want to urge the government that if they discuss this issue first, there are chances that a solution can be arrived at with regard to the condition of jawans posted on Siachen. We should also talk to China,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Yadav&#8217;s party colleague Pavan Varma, who is a former Foreign Service officer, raised the issue of China forging closer trade and diplomatic ties with Nepal, a development he said could have &#8220;serious strategic implications&#8221; for India.</p>
<p>Varma referred to the visit of Nepalese Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli to China last month during which the two sides signed a transit agreement that includes access to Chinese ports as well as the potential construction of rail links between the two countries.</p>
<p>The Ministry of External Affairs says that this trip and the pacts will not have any serious implication for India, he noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we doing to strengthen our relationship with Nepal? What is China&#8217;s nefarious game in this region? I think sometimes the government&#8217;s eye is off the strategic ball,&#8221; said the former IFS officer who served as Ambassador to various countries, including Bhutan.</p>
<p>Some <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> MPs also associated themselves with the issue raised by Varma.</p>

(Source: Twitter)
<p>Newly-appointed Goa Lokayukta Justice (Retd) Prafulla Kumar Misra will begin hearing into the illegal mining cases lodged with it from the stage where the ombudsman body discontinued hearings due to resignation of its former head Justice (Retd) K Sudershan Reddy.</p>
<p>&#8220;In case of illegal mining, there are some cases which are pending. They would be pursued from that stage onwards,&#8221; Misra, who was on Thursday sworn-in as the Lokayukta of the coastal state filling the position which was vacant for two and a half years, told PTI.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand some cases (about illegal mining) are also in the court. If some matter is in court we are not supposed to interfere. I will get update of each case. If court has already decided then we can&#8217;t hear,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Justice M B Shah Commission, in its probe on iron ore extraction and export industry of Goa, had pointed out rampant illegal mining in the state in 2010.</p>
<p>The then Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar had announced that the file affixing civil liabilities on various people, including mine owners and government officials, was sent to Goa Lokayukta.</p>
<p>The then Lokayukta Justice (Retd) Reddy had resigned in October 2013 virtually crippling the functioning of this institution.</p>
<p>&#8220;(For) two and half years those cases were in cold storage. (In) all those matters we will have to give a fresh date and issue them notices,&#8221; Misra said referring to 22 general cases (including that of illegal mining) which are currently pending before the ombudsman body.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have asked the staff to get all those files and the dates would be fixed depending on what should be done (in those cases). In some cases they were waiting for the reply of public functionary, in some cases they are waiting for issuance of fresh notice to the competent authority, in some cases they were waiting for the rejoinder of the complainant,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, all those cases have to be taken up. We will have to go through record of each case,&#8221; the Lokayukta said.</p>

<p>Railways is considering a slew of innovative measures like exploiting space rights over station buildings, sponsorship of uniforms for its personnel, commercial farming alongside tracks, in its bid to boost non-fare revenue.</p>
<p>Minister of Railways Suresh Prabhu gave these details in Rajya Sabha during the Question Hour, where he also informed members that the government is working to complete the dedicated freight corridor by 2019 after which it is expected that the average speed of Indian trains would go up substantially by 2020.</p>
<p>The Minister said a Mobility Directorate had been set up to look at aspects related to increasing speed while another Directorate has come up to deal with non-fare revenues.</p>

<p>In successful railway systems across the world, non-fare revenues form a big chunk but with regard to Indian Railways, these earnings are not significant. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t increase non fare revenue, financial viability of Railways will be affected,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The areas that the directorate to deal with non-fare revenues would deal include advertisements at stations, tracks or coaches, commercial exploitation of vacant land and space rights over station buildings. It would also look at sponsoring uniforms for its personnel, commercial farming alongside tracks and attempts to monetise rail database.</p>
<p>Sponsorship of activities and events at stations, pay-and-use toilets in land outside stations, radio, video, internet,<br />
Wi-Fi, mobile apps, interactive services like video games in railway premises are also being looked at.</p>
<p>Prabhu also told members that the government was working to increase speed of trains and emphasised that safety would in no way be compromised.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will try to complete the Dedicated Freight Corridor by 2019. When that happens, it will also help in increasing the average speed as presently the freight and passenger trains move on the same tracks. We have kept a target of increasing the average speed of our trains substantially by 2020,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Prabhu said work was going on in stretches like Mughal Sarai-Allahabad on the Kolkata-Delhi trunk route to reduce<br />
congestion.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not necessary that speed of the train and safety have to conflict with each other. It is always possible to increase the speed of the train while also ensuring safety,&#8221; Prabhu said, citing Japan as an example where the Shinkansen trains have the highest speed and lowest record of accidents.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you actually bring in high speed trains and integrate signalling, track and rolling stock, the possibility of accidents goes down,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Later to a question by Sukhendu Sekhar Roy of TMC, Prabhu said work was continuing on the East-West line in Kolkata and added &#8220;hopefully when your party will come back to power, we will be able to work with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>JNU authorities have sent Delhi Police the report of a five-member panel on the controversial February 9 event during which anti-national slogans were allegedly raised. The report was sought from the Chief Proctor&#8217;s Office by Delhi Police&#8217;s anti-terrorism unit, Special Cell, which is probing the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/what-is-section-124-a-under-which-one-is-charged-with-sedition/">sedition</a> case registered in connection with the event on the campus against hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru.</p>
<p>&#8220;The special cell had contacted us for a copy of the report and we have sent the same,&#8221; a senior university official said. JNUSU President Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya were arrested in connection with the sedition case in February, triggering widespread protests. They are now out on bail.</p>

<p>On basis of the recommendations of the probe panel, JNU had earlier this week announced punishments against several students in connection with the event. While Kanhaiya has been slapped with a penalty of Rs 10,000 on grounds of &#8220;indiscipline and misconduct&#8221;, Umar, Anirban and Kashmiri student Mujeeb Gatoo have been rusticated for varying durations.</p>
<p>Financial penalty has been imposed on 14 students. Hostel facilities of two students have been withdrawn and the university has declared the campus out of bounds for two former students. ABVP member Saurabh Sharma, who was complainant of the event, has also been slapped with a fine of Rs 10,000 for blocking traffic.</p>
<p>The report has two sections &#8212; findings and recommendations. The inquiry had brought out four major aspects of the entire row &#8212; the event, the procession, the sloganeering and the lapses on part of the administration. The section on findings was last month shared by the university with 21 students who have been issued a show-cause notice in this connection but the recommendations have been kept out of public domain.</p>
<p>The inquiry panel had concluded that provocative slogans at the event were raised by a group of outsiders. However, it was &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; that the students allowed that to happen, it had said. The panel had also noted lapses on part of the university&#8217;s security unit, saying it did not make any efforts to stop outsiders from shouting slogans and stopping them from leaving the campus.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2776199&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>It is not possible to achieve 100 per cent self-reliance in defence production as certain components required in limited numbers have to be purchased off-the-shelf to save money, the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/lok-sabha/">Lok Sabha</a> was informed on Friday.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said during Question Hour that huge costs will have to be incurred if certain components are produced in small numbers and it would be better to buy it from open market.</p>
<p>He said this in response to a supplementary on by when India will be 100 per cent self-reliant in defence production.</p>

<p>Parrikar said to attain a high degree of self sufficiency, 70 per cent was a good figure. He, however, did not specify as to whether India has achieved 70 per cent self sufficiency.</p>
<p>Referring to the &#8216;Make in India&#8217; initiative, he said under the &#8216;Make one&#8217; programme, government funds 90 per cent of the project cost and the manufacturer has to develop the item to the satisfaction of the forces within two years. If that happens, then the government buys that item.</p>
<p>Under &#8216;Make two&#8217;, the industry puts its money to produce an item which, if found satisfactory, is purchased by the forces.</p>
<p>In his written response, Parrikar said the expenditure in respect of orders placed on foreign vendors, primarily from countries like US, Russia, Israel and France, have come down from Rs 35082.10 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 24992.36 crore in 2014-15 and Rs 22422.12 crore in 2015-16.</p>
<p>He said even in cases where current operational exigencies necessitate import of defence equipment, efforts are made to ensure the involvement of Indian industry as production agencies and offset partners.</p>
<p>He also clarified that no target is fixed for import of defence equipment and therefore, no separate budgetary allocation is made against such targets.</p>

<p>Kerala&#8217;s Pathanapuram constituency will literally witness a &#8216;star war&#8217; in the May 16 Assembly polls as three film actors cross swords in their bid to wrest the segment.</p>
<p>Sitting MLA K B Ganesh Kumar of Kerala <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> (B), known for his heroic and character roles, has been backed by LDF while Jagadish, popular comedian and TV host, has been roped in by UDF and <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> has put up Raghu Damodaran alias Bheeman Raghu, who played a villain in many movies.</p>
<p>The three actors have set aside their tinsel town friendships and are aggressively campaigning against each other to woo voters.</p>

<p>While it is an electoral debut for Jagadish and Raghu, Kumar will look to retain the constituency, where he had gotten 71,421 votes in the 2011 polls.</p>
<p>In what may be seen as irony, 49-year-old Kumar, who had won the constituency thrice in a row from 2001 under the UDF banner, is now seeking his fourth stint under the LDF bandwagon.</p>
<p>His opponents have taken up this association with LDF as a major campaign tool against him, terming it an example of &#8216;political opportunism&#8217;.</p>
<p>Kumar and his party had distanced from Congress-led UDF after he quit the present Oommen Chandy government as minister of Forests, Sports and Cinema following a domestic violence case filed against him by his former wife on April 7, 2013.</p>
<p>It was not a smooth sailing for Kumar when joining the LDF fold initially as there were rumblings over his candidature as he had made some objectionable comments against CPI(M) veteran V S Achuthanandan during his tenure as minister in the Chandy government.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2776211&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8220;Speaker Ryan&#8217;s decision to invite Prime Minister Modi to address Congress demonstrates the growing commitment to strengthening the strategic partnership between the US and India,&#8221; said Senators Mark Warner and John Cornyn in a joint statement.</p>
<p>Warner from the Democratic Party and Cornyn from the Republican Party are co-chairs if Senate India Caucus, the only country specific caucus in the US Senate.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a key security partner with a flourishing economy, a thriving relationship with India presents tremendous opportunities to reach our joint economic and strategic goals. Prime Minister Modi&#8217;s visit presents an opportunity to energise efforts to improve bilateral ties between our two countries,&#8221; Warner and Cornyn said after Ryan told reporters that he has invited Modi to address a joint meeting of the US Congress on June 8.</p>
<p>In fact, Modi would be the first foreign leader to address a joint meeting of the Congress after Ryan became the Speaker last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will be the first joint meeting of this speakership. We certainly look forward to welcoming Prime Minister Modi in the United States Capitol this summer, I  believe it&#8217;s June 8th,&#8221; Ryan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;India is the most populace democracy and soon it&#8217;s going to be the most populace country. The friendship between our nations is a pillar of stability in a very, very important region. This address presents a special opportunity for us to deepen our ties with our ally, India,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a chance to hear from the prime minister on how we can work together to promote our shared values and to increase prosperity,&#8221; Ryan said.</p>
<p>Congressman Brad Sherman welcomed Ryan&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am pleased that India&#8217;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be able to address a Joint Session of Congress this year,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2014, I led the effort, and was joined by more than 80 of my colleagues, in trying to encourage then-Speaker John Boehner to invite President Modi to give such an address shortly after he had assumed office,&#8221; Sherman said.</p>
<p>Following the letter of 80 US lawmakers, the then Speaker Boehner in a letter had invited Modi before his September 2014 Washington DC visit to address a joint meeting of the US Congress.</p>
<p>However that could not happen as the Congress was in recess ahead of the 2014 general elections for the Congress.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister&#8217;s office has not said yet if the invitation has been accepted.</p>
<p>If he accepts the invitation, Modi would be the fifth Indian Prime Minister to address a joint meeting of the US Congress and the first in more than a decade.</p>
<p>Manmohan Singh was the last Indian Prime Minister to address a joint meeting of the US Congress had addressed on July 19, 2005.</p>
<p>Other Prime Minister to get the honour were Atal Bihari Vajpayee (September 14, 2000), P V Narasimha Rao (May 18, 1994) and Rajiv Gandhi (July 13, 1985).</p>
<p>&#8220;Since India&#8217;s independence in 1947, the relationship between the United States and India has steadily grown. The United States and India have a unique relationship based on shared democratic values. The Prime Minister&#8217;s visit is an opportunity to build on the US-India strategic partnership to the benefit of both our nations,&#8221; Sherman said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As things stand, our current trade relationship amounts to around USD110 billion. I am encouraged by Prime Minister Modi&#8217;s reform efforts and hope we can work together to make it easier for US companies to invest in India and increase US exports. I look forward to hearing directly from President Modi about this issue,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I applaud Speaker Ryan for inviting Prime Minister Modi to address a Joint Meeting of Congress, and I look forward to welcoming the Prime Minister to the Capitol. This address will serve as a sign of the deep and important relationship between the United States and India,&#8221; said Ed Royce, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our partnership in areas such as defence, nuclear power, renewable energy and space exploration is very strong, thanks to our many shared values. I look forward to hearing from Prime Minister Modi about how we can continue working together to promote peace and prosperity,&#8221; Royce said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I look forward to welcoming Prime Minister Modi to Washington in June, where his address to a Joint Session of Congress will explore how our two nations can work together to further our shared values and interests,&#8221; said Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, the first ever Hindu lawmaker elected to the US Congress.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;As the world&#8217;s oldest and largest democracies, the US and India have many shared values and objectives. Since Prime Minister Modi was first elected in 2014, he has made active engagement with the United States a priority on many levels including exploring mutually beneficial economic opportunities, stronger government-to-government relations, and enhanced security engagements,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2776205&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
