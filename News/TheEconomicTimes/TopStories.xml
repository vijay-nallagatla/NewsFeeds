As part of a transparency drive, the government has made public direct tax data for last 15 years. Data for individuals has been published only for 2012-13 assessment year, which shows taxes for income in financial year ended March 31, 2012.  A total of 2.87 crore individuals filed income tax returns for that year, but 1.62 crore of them did not pay any tax - leaving the number of taxpayers at just about 1.25 crore which was close to one per cent of the country's total population of about 123 crore at that time.  The tax outgo was less than Rs 1.5 lakh for a vast majority of nearly 89 per cent taxpayers (over 1.11 crore). Their average tax payable was just about Rs 21,000, while the collective amount stood at over Rs 23,000 crore.  The three individuals in the top-bracket of Rs 100-500 crore paid a total tax of Rs 437 crore - resulting in an average tax outgo of Rs 145.80 crore.  As many as 5,430 individuals paid income tax of over Rs 1 crore. Out of this, the tax range was Rs 1-5 crore for more than 5,000 individuals, resulting in a total outgo of Rs 8,907 crore.  As per the overall data, total income tax collections rose nine-fold to Rs 2.86 lakh crore in 2015-16, from Rs 31,764 crore in 2000-01.  The data further said that the bulk of individuals who filed returns for the assessment year 2012-13 earned an annual salary between Rs 5.5 lakh and Rs 9.5 lakh. Over 20.23 lakh taxpayers earned Rs 5.5-9.5 lakh, while their cumulative salary earnings stood at Rs 1.40 lakh crore in the financial year 2011-12.  Further 19.18 lakh individuals earned salary of Rs 2.5-3.5 lakh that year.  Six individuals fell in the high-end earning bracket of Rs 50-100 crore of salary income.  In the salary range of Rs 1-5 crore, there were as many as 17,515 individuals.  Nearly 2.87 crore salary earners filed their I-T returns in assessment year 2012-13.  </description><link>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/just-1-per-cent-of-population-pay-taxes-over-5000-paid-more-than-rs-1-crore/articleshow/52063151.cms</link><guid>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/just-1-per-cent-of-population-pay-taxes-over-5000-paid-more-than-rs-1-crore/articleshow/52063151.cms</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 13:02:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ahead of PM Modi's visit, India says ready to clear Iran's $6.5 bn oil dues</title><description>NEW DELHI: Keen to step up engagement in hydrocarbon sector with Iran, India has conveyed to the Persian Gulf nation that it was ready to clear nearly $6.5 billion of the dues for oil import from that country at the earliest, provided there was clarity on payment channel.  The message has been conveyed to Iran even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to visit the oil-rich country later this month.  Government sources said there has been a series of discussions at various levels both in Tehran and here and both sides were confident of resolving the issue soon.  "We are working on clearing the dues to Iran and are hopeful that the issue will be resolved soon," they said.  Following lifting of sanctions against it in January under a historic nuclear deal, Iran had terminated a three-year-old system with India of getting paid for half of the oil dues in rupees and has been insisting on being paid in Euros for the oil it sells to Indian refiners.  It has also scrapped free delivery of crude oil to Indian refiners.  Officials said though Western sanctions against Iran were lifted, problems persist in banking channels due to which regular transactions were not possible yet.  Refiners like Essar Oil and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MPRL) owe nearly $6.5 billion in dues to Iran.  Since February 2013, Indian refiners like Essar Oil and MRPL paid 45 per cent of their import bill in rupees to UCO Bank account of Iranian oil company. The remaining has been accumulating, pending finalisation of a payment mechanism.  Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had visited Iran last month during which they had conveyed to Iranian leaders that India wants to significantly ramp up engagement in oil and gas sector with that country. The issue of the pending dues had also figured in the meetings.  Swaraj during her visit had conveyed to Iranian leadership that India wants to invest in joint ventures in oil and gas sectors in the Persian Gulf nation where foreign investors from major economic powers are rushing in to get early footholds after lifting of sanctions.  Following lifting of sanctions against Iran, India has been eying deeper energy ties with that country and has already lined up $20 billion as investment in oil and gas as well as petrochemical and fertiliser projects there.  New Delhi is looking to increase engagement with the sanction-free Iran by raising oil imports and possible shipments of natural gas. It also wants rights to develop Farzad-B gas field in the Persian Gulf discovered by OVL.  A deal for the field was not signed during Pradhan's visit as Iranian Parliament, Majlis, is yet to approve the new Iran Petroleum Contract (IPC) under which the Farzad-B field is to be given to the OVL-led consortium.  Indian firms have so far shied away from investing in Iran for the fear of being sanctioned by the US and Europe.  The same was deterring New Delhi from claiming rights to invest nearly $7 billion in the biggest gas discovery ever made by an Indian firm abroad. But after the lifting of sanctions, India is making a renewed pitch for rights to develop 12.8 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves OVL had found in 2008.  Pradhan also conveyed to the Iranian side that both countries must expand the basket of oil and gas trade.  He had also expressed India's interest in importing LPG from Iran and said companies from both sides could discuss setting up of an extraction plant in Chabahar, if required.  India's total crude import in 2015-16 was around 184 million tonnes.  Iran had in November 2013 offered free delivery of crude oil to Indian refiners as tough Western sanctions crippled its exports. With shipping lines refusing to transport Iranian crude for fear of being sanctioned, Iran used its shipping line for the delivery and did not charge for transportation. </description><link>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/india-ready-to-clear-6-5-billion-of-irans-oil-dues/articleshow/52063639.cms</link><guid>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/india-ready-to-clear-6-5-billion-of-irans-oil-dues/articleshow/52063639.cms</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 10:00:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>PM Narendra Modi got a first class in MA from Gujarat University</title><description>AHMEDABAD: Amid the raging row over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's educational qualification, the Gujarat University today shared details of his MA degree saying he scored 62.3 per cent as an external student of the varsity.  The details were shared by the Gujarat University after the Central Information Commission directed it to provide the same to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who had recently criticised the functioning of the transparency panel.  "Narendra Damodardas Modi passed his MA in Political Science in 1983 with first class, securing 499 out of 800 marks, which comes to 62.3 per cent as an external student," Gujarat University's Vice Chancellor M N Patel told PTI today.  Kejriwal, in a letter to CIC in response to an RTI application seeking details of his electoral photo identity card (EPIC), demanded that while he was ready to share information sought by RTI applicants, the CIC must also order disclosure of educational qualifications of the PM.  After Kejriwal's letter, the CIC had on Friday ordered Delhi University, from where he pursued his Bachelor of Arts (BA) course, and Gujarat University, from where he completed his MA, to reveal details of his education qualifications.  Vice Chancellor Patel said he has not received any order of CIC till now, but he came to know about it from media, and will give the details to concerned applicants if he receives the order.  "The details (of Modi's degree) were sought through several Right to Information (RTI) applications filed before the university, but we were not in a position to share the details under the RTI Act on technical grounds," Patel said.  "The details of marks can only be provided to the candidate himself, and we do not provide details of university records beyond 20 years," he said.  When asked about the details of Modi's BA degree, Patel said they do not have it.  "Modi did his MA as an external candidate. He secured 237 out of 400 marks in MA first year, and 262 out of 400 marks in MA second year," Patel said giving the details.  "The breakup of marks in second year MA shows that Modi obtained 64 marks in political science, 62 marks in European and social political thoughts, 69 marks in modern India/political analysis, and 67 marks in political psychology," he said.  The CIC, acting on the letter from Kejriwal, had asked the Delhi University and Gujarat University to "make best possible search for the information regarding degrees in the name of Mr Narendra Damodardas Modi in the year 1978 (Graduation in DU) and 1983 (Post Graduation in GU) and provide it to the appellant Mr Kejriwal as soon as possible".  The genesis of the case is in two previous CIC orders and a scathing letter from Kejriwal to Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu where he demanded that while he was ready to share information sought by RTI applicants, the CIC must also order disclosure of educational qualifications of the Prime Minister.  In a case related to one Neeraj Pandey, who sought information about electoral photo identity card of the Delhi Chief Minister, Acharyulu had sought explanation from Kejriwal why he as an MLA be not declared as Public authority under the RTI Act and why his party too was not brought under the Act.  Kejriwal in his response did not object to disclosure of information about him but raised a demand for information about Prime Minister's educational qualifications referring to Hans Raj Jain case, Acharyulu had noted.  "He stated that while CIC wanted Mr Kejriwal's information to be given, CIC was obstructing the information about degrees of Mr Modi, the Prime Minister. He expressed surprise over this and also doubted objectivity of the Commission," Acharyulu said.  </description><link>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-narendra-modi-got-a-first-class-in-ma-from-gujarat-university/articleshow/52061558.cms</link><guid>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-narendra-modi-got-a-first-class-in-ma-from-gujarat-university/articleshow/52061558.cms</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 09:25:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>IRNSS to free India from dependence on US, Russia</title><description>By Vanita Srivastava  April 28. At 12.50 pm sharp, a 44.4-metre-tall PSLV rocket, weighing 320 tonnes, blasted into the clear afternoon skies from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh with a blazing orangered tail trailing behind. After zooming through the sky for nearly 20 minutes, the satellite IRNSS-1G was ejected from the rocket and injected into an elliptical orbit. It swiftly opened its solar panels.  Back home, the mission control room of Indian Space Research Organisation(ISRO) resonated with thunderous applause. The scientists who were till then glued to their monitors burst into cheers. India's mini GPS, a regional positioning system, was ready to be rolled out.  Prime minister Narendra Modi who was watching the launch live from his office in Delhi congratulated the scientists. "With this successful launch, we will determine our own paths powered by our technology. This is an example of made in India and made for Indians," he said. The navigational structure was given a new name — NavIC (Navigation Indian Constellation) — by the prime minister. "125 crore Indians have got a new Navic," he tweeted.  Desi GPS The seven-satellite constellation, IRNSS (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System), is designed to provide a regional positioning system for India with the least number of satellites. It is expected to provide accurate position information service to users in India and 1,500 km around the Indian mainland.  NavIC will provide two types of services — Standard Positioning Service for all users, and Restricted Service, which is an encrypted service provided only to authorised users. It is expected to provide position accuracy that is better than 20 metres in the primary service area.  Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, head of space policy initiative at Observer Research Foundation, says IRNSS is primarily meant for India's own use and will liberate it from its dependence on the US' Global Positioning System (GPS), Russia's Glonass and other foreign systems, which are not under its control and therefore potentially dangerous during conflicts, in particular.  "IRNSS has multiple navigation applications, everything from providing autonomous navigation capability to Indian soldiers, sailors and airmen. It also provides India with a part of an extremely accurate guidance system for everything from GPS-enabled bombs to long-range missiles," says Rajagopalan. Ajey Lele, space expert and assistant director of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, says IRNSS has both commercial and strategic utility. "India may allow its neighbours to use this system and so it has foreign policy relevance," he says.  The first of the seven satellites, IRNSS-1A, was launched on July 2, 2013. Six satellites have already started functioning from their designated orbital slots after extensive on-orbit test and evaluation. With the launch and operationalisation of IRNSS-1G, the seventh in the constellation, the navigational system is complete. The cost of each satellite is around Rs 125 crore while the total cost of constellation is around Rs 1,410 crore.  Major areas of applications include terrestrial, aerial and marine navigation, disaster management, integration with mobile phones, terrestrial navigational aid for hikers and travellers, visual and voice navigation for drivers.             It could take up to a year for one to use NavIC on the phone, though. First the IRNSS has to be formally declared operational. Antennas, receivers and chip sets to get the signals are being developed. Entrepreneurs will have to use them and bring out commercial receivers and incorporate them on smartphones for position information. Besides the GPS of the US and Russia, the other players in the navigational field are China and the European Union.   The navigational feat comes a year and half after India had its first date with Mars. The mission to Mars, on a shoestring budget of Rs 450 crore, had put the nation in a new orbit. That was September 24, 2014.  What Next? While new missions to Mars, Venus and an asteroid are still at discussion stages, a second mission to the moon is aimed to expand India's scientific knowledge and upgrade its technological capability. Chandrayaan-2, a fully indigenous mission, is planned to be launched by GSLV Mk II in the first quarter of 2018. The sun mission, Aditya-L1, plans to study the solar dynamics in the chromosphere and the corona. The satellite will be launched in 2019-20 by PSLVXL.  Aditya-L1 — called so because the satellite will be placed in the orbit around Lagrangian point 1 (L1) of the sunearth system and will have the advantage of continuously viewing the sun without any occultation or eclipses — is meant to observe the sun's photosphere, chromosphere and corona.  India is also in the process of building what is called a "SAARC satellite": to provide satellite communication services to nations in the neighbourhood. A communication and meteorological satellite, it is expected to be launched before December 2016.  Towards the end of the year, with the launch of GSLV Mk III, India's space mission could become self-reliant and move out of procured launches from foreign shores. GSLV Mk III, billed as the heaviest rocket, is meant for the launch of a 4 tonne class satellite to geostationary transfer orbit. After a successful sub-orbital test in 2014, ISRO is readying for the launch of communication satellite GSAT 19 by GSLV Mk III in December 2016.  From launching the first satellite with all equipment sourced from foreign nations to taking up the Mars Mission with indigenous technology and now synchronising just seven satellites for a mini GPS, the country has taken a giant leap.

Rentals also fell by 1 per cent during the last one year.  The report captures capital and rental price trends of the residential realty market on quarterly basis across seven major cities of India.  "Property prices per sq ft in Delhi NCR witnessed a minimal downtrend of 1 per cent in January-March as compared to October-December 2015," the company said in a statement.  The rental market, too, plateaued over the last one year, it said.  "Delhi NCR's real estate graph continued to delineate a marginal downtrend, with the land pooling policy of the government offering a ray of hope," said Narasimha Jayakumar, Chief Business Officer, 99acres.  The national capital also witnessed the second highest absorption of office space in the country, predicting an optimistic future for the rental landscape, in the long run, he added.  "Most buyers and inventors await the completion of the Noida-Greater Noida metro corridor, anticipating an overhaul in the real estate story of the twin cities," Jayakumar said.  In Delhi, the capital market of apartments continued to remain lacklustre in the first quarter of 2015 with limited number of new launches across the city.  "A few localities fared well on the capital growth index, primarily due to over-ambitious 'ask' rates by sellers. One such locality, Dilshad Garden, noted a capital hike of 5 per cent in January-March 2016 against the previous quarter,"  Despite the huge supply pipeline, some sectors in Dwarka -- sector 14, 12 and 7 -- witnessed a quarterly increase in capital values to the tune of 2-3 per cent. </description><link>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/real-estate/housing-prices-down-1-during-march-quarter-in-delhi-ncr-99acres/articleshow/51993562.cms</link><guid>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/real-estate/housing-prices-down-1-during-march-quarter-in-delhi-ncr-99acres/articleshow/51993562.cms</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2016 10:16:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Realty Developers start consolidating office assets</title><description>MUMBAI | BENGALURU | NEW DELHI: Realty developers including DLF, K Raheja Corp and Embassy Properties that have commercial property that can be listed as real estate investment trusts (REITs), have started consolidating their office assets.  However, the possibility of the first REIT hitting the market is still sometime away as issues such as state-level stamp duty and creating optimal structures to group assets into trusts may take time.  State-level stamp duty needs to be paid by the companies while transferring their properties to a holding company that would act as a REIT sponsor.  "More than capital gains tax, the mechanism and the process to structure your vehicle to make it tax efficient for the sponsor and investor is an important aspect," said Shashank Jain, partner, transaction services, PwC. "Apart from this, what is critical is the current return-expectation mismatch, which, hopefully, will soon go away and there would be a convergence on commercial expectations by all stakeholders."  Finance Minister Arun ​Jaitley removed dividend distribution tax (DDT) on REITs in his February 29 Budget, a move that's expected to speed up the formation of such entities. While a major hurdle in the form of DDT has been cleared, experts and developers have been voicing their concerns over pending issues.  "There are still some tax issues while doing a REIT in India, abolishing of DDT alone is not sufficient for companies to launch REITs in the coming months as there is a bigger hurdle in the form of capital gains (while transferring the asset)," said Jitu Virwani, CMD of Embassy Properties. "It is better to opt for commercial IPO (initial public offering) than going for REIT listing."  Although introduction of REITs has been under discussion for several years, none have yet been formed given the lack of clarity on taxation. REITs own properties and their rental income is distributed among investors. Under current rules, DDT on such payouts is 15%.  Developers have already started work on consolidating commercial projects.  The exercise is aimed at having better focus and control if any monetisation is undertaken later on.  "In order to grow our commercial vertical further and have better focus on these projects, we are working towards creating a separate commercial development entity," said Vinod Rohira, managing director, K Raheja Corp. "We will hold all our existing and planned office assets under one umbrella. From DDT perspective, decks have been cleared, but other factors like stamp duty need attention to make REITs a possibility."  K Raheja Corp's commercial assets portfolio is spread over 20 million sq ft across Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. "We are in no rush to hurry into a REIT listing," Rohira said.  With developers owning assets across various states, streamlining stamp duty and having a policy acceptable to all states is necessary to prevent tax disputes cropping up.  "Given that stamp duty is a state subject and most of these companies own assets across various states, the scenario can get complicated (administratively)," said Rajeev Bairathi, executive director at Knight Frank India. "Companies will have to pay stamp duty to various states wherever they own assets. Government will have to come up with some policy that will be acceptable to the state governments."  Concern over the possible public response is also expected to hold REITs back.  "Today, there is larger interest in the private market compared to capital markets given the volatility in the capital markets worldwide," said DLF's senior executive director, finance, Saurabh Chawla. "In such conditions, no investor will put in money into an instrument like REITs at this stage. Once the volatility goes away, there is significant amount of capital targeted for this asset class."  He expects the first REITs to be set up in about 9-12 months, given the various issues that need to be resolved. These include Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulations, preparations that companies need to make and volatility in the capital markets.  "We are going with step one right now in which DLF's promoters are selling their 40% stake in DLF Cyber City Developers Ltd (DCCDL)," he said. "Once this is done, the SPV (special purpose vehicle) will be created and the joint owners will then take a call on the multiple REITs that we need to create."  </description><link>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/51248436.cms</link><guid>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/51248436.cms</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2016 23:09:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Flying from IGI Airport gets cheaper</title><description>NEW DELHI: Flying out of IGI Airport here has got cheaper from today with the discontinuation of the development fee being charged from each passenger for the past several years.  Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), the joint venture company which runs the IGI airport, was allowed to levy Rs 100 per flight as Development Fee (DF) from passengers flying on domestic routes and Rs 600 from those flying to international destinations.  The airports tariff regulator Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) had in February issued an order directing DIAL to discontinue DF from May 1, after having allowed it to levy DF through a December 2012 order.  Citing the average monthly collection of Rs 30 crore as DF, the AERA had in its order in February said the total sanctioned DF amount of Rs 3,415.35 crore was likely to be recovered by April 30, 2016. To cover the financial gap in developing the airport, the allowable DF was determined at Rs 3,415.35 crore.  Last month, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had also asked all airlines operating from Delhi to refund the development fee charged from passengers flying out of the IGI Airport on the tickets booked for journey beyond April 30.  DIAL is a joint venture between GMR group, Airports Authority of India and Germany's Fraport AG. </description><link>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/flying-from-igi-airport-gets-cheaper/articleshow/52064924.cms</link><guid>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/flying-from-igi-airport-gets-cheaper/articleshow/52064924.cms</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 12:25:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>ICICI Bank top-brass foregoes performance bonus</title><description>NEW DELHI: Leading private sector lender ICICI Bank, which has posted a sharp plunge in its fourth quarter net profit, has decided against grant of 'performance bonus' to its senior management team for the fiscal 2015-16.  "We have decided that the senior management would not receive performance bonus for FY2016. Performance bonus would however be paid to employees in the grades of Deputy General Manager and below," ICICI Bank's Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar said in a post-results analyst call.  Kochhar herself was paid 'performance bonus' of over Rs 1.6 crore for the fiscal 2014-15, as per the bank's annual report for that year. Among others, Executive Director NS Kannan was paid a performance bonus of over Rs 1.1 crore.  The bank pays "performance linked retention pay (PLRP) to its front-line staff and junior management and performance bonus to its middle and senior management".  In its worst performance in over a decade, ICICI Bank on Friday posted 87 per cent plunge in consolidated net profit to Rs 406.71 crore for the March quarter on spike in provisioning for bad loans and creation of a contingency reserve to cushion any future loan defaults.  While provisioning for NPAs more than doubled to Rs 3,326 crore in view of the Reserve Bank's asset quality review (AQR) directive, the country's largest private sector lender has set aside a large amount of Rs 3,600 crore as reserves for any potential shocks in the future.  Stating that the bank has completed the exercise of review of classification of cases as per RBI's AQR directive, Kochhar told the analysts, "We continue to work towards resolution and reduction of exposures through sale of assets and deleveraging, as can be seen in some of the recently announced transactions.  "The weak global economic environment, sharp downturn in commodity cycle and the gradual nature of the domestic economic recovery has adversely impacted borrowers in certain sectors like iron and steel, mining, power, rigs and cement.  "While the banks are working towards resolution of stress on certain borrowers in these sectors, it may take some time for solutions to be worked out. In view of the above, the Bank has on a prudent basis made a collective contingency and related reserve of Rs 3,600 crore during fourth quarter towards exposures to these sectors."  She emphasised that this was "over and above" the provisions made for non-performing and restructured loans as per RBI guidelines.  Kochhar further said the bank has ended the year 2015-16 with "a very strong capital position, with Tier-1 capital adequacy of 13.09 per cent and total capital adequacy of 16.04 per cent, well above regulatory requirements".  In the analyst call, Kannan said the operating expenses rose by 10.3 per cent in the fiscal 2015-16, while employee expenses rose by 5.3 per cent.  During the fiscal, the bank added about 6,239 employees primarily in front-line roles in the retail and rural banking business. Non-employee expenses increased by 13.9 per cent in fiscal 2016 primarily on account of the larger distribution network and higher retail lending volumes, he added. </description><link>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/icici-bank-top-brass-foregoes-performance-bonus/articleshow/52064906.cms</link><guid>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/icici-bank-top-brass-foregoes-performance-bonus/articleshow/52064906.cms</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 12:23:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The week that was: Realty, banking stocks shone as BoJ, earnings hurt</title><description>NEW DELHI: It was a poor weak for domestic stocks, with concerns over poor growth of India Inc cropping up on back-to-back earnings disappointments from blue chip companies.  While the outcome of US FOMC meeting was market-friendly and hopes for a June rate hike receded during the week, modest GDP growth in the US and earnings of some of the top companies in the US and Europe raised worries that the health of the global economy is anything but in the pink.  Adding to concerns was the Bank of Japan (BoJ) policy outcome on Thursday, where the Japanese central bank refrained from expanding its stimulus programme.  The outcome triggered across-the-board selling globally, and raised fears that central banks are left with little room to revive their economies.  Fourth quarter numbers by frontline companies such as ICICI Bank, HCL Technologies and Vedanta amid the expiry of April series futures and options contracts further dampened sentiment.  The BSE Sensex shed 231.52 points, or 0.89 per cent, during the week to settle at 25,606.62 on Friday. The NSE Nifty50 declined 49.50 points, or 0.62 per cent, to close the week at 7,849.80.  "Given the Nifty50's movement in a narrow band over the past two weeks just about the crucial long-term red channel resistance trend line, the breakout of its past two weeks' high and low at 7,992 and 7,788 levels would decide its next trend. The daily trend has a negative bias," said Birendrakumar Singh, AVP - Technical Research at Systematix Shares &amp; Stocks.  Investors' equity wealth, as suggested by the combined market capitalisation of BSE-listed stocks, fell by Rs 47,384 crore during the week to Rs 97,10,538 crore.  PSU stocks alone shed Rs 19,806 crore in market capitalisation. The BSE PSU index was the second worst on the BSE for the week that saw the NHPC issue failing to receive enough retail demand though it managed to sail through on institutional subscription.  Among the sectoral indices, BSE power index dropped 2.21 per cent during the week to close at 1,843.34 on Friday. It was followed by BSE consumer durables (down 1.25 per cent), BSE auto (down 1.24 per cent), BSE capital goods (down 1.21 per cent) and BSE oil &amp; gas (down 1.08 per cent) indices.  Sectoral gainers included the BSE Realty index (up 3.75 per cent), BSE Bankex (up 0.42 per cent) and BSE TECk (0.31 per cent).  Among the Nifty50 stocks, while a total of 30 stocks trended lower, 21 others gained for the week. Losers included HCL Technologies, which slumped 11.22 per cent to end the week at Rs 750.30. The IT major reported 1.3 per cent sequential growth in dollar revenues for the March quarter, compared with a consensus estimate of 2.5 per cent.  Shares of ICICI Bank fell 5.97 per cent for the week. The lender reported 76 per cent plunge in YoY net profit for the fourth quarter to Rs 702 crore, as it set aside additional contingency reserve of Rs 3,600 crore.  SBI, Reliance Industries, Hindalco Industries and UltraTech Cement were some of the Nifty50 stocks that tanked between 4.7 per cent and 5.6 per cent during the week.  Lenders Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank, besides TCS, Adani Ports and Zee Entertainment were among the Nifty50 gainers, which advanced between 3.5 per cent and 7.7 per cent.  Market outlook During the coming trading week, some 149 companies are likely to announce their March quarter numbers.  HDFC, Jindal Steel, Adani Power, Grasim Industries, GCPL and Titan would be among the companies announcing their quarterly earnings for the March quarter along with Siemens, Pfizer, Reliance Capital and NIIT Technologies.  "The first half of May would be hard because it would be difficult for the market to probably gather a trend. In the last four months, it has been more of a global play which has impacted the market trend," said Kunal Bothra, Head Advisory, LKP.  "The first important support for Nifty50 is at 7,700. Till the time we do not take out that support, we could probably be in a safer territory. On the other hand, the 8,250 level is the more significant resistance for Nifty50 on a medium-term basis," Bothra said.  Globally, markets across Hong Kong, China, UK, Russia, Greece, South Africa, Ireland, Thailand and Malaysia, among others, will be closed on Monday on account of a public holiday. But the market will pay heed to Chinese official manufacturing PMI readings that would be out on Monday.  Domestic and European manufacturing PMI readings will also be out on the same day. On Tuesday, the Japanese market will remain closed on account of the Constitution Day.  PPI data in Europe will be released on the same day. The domestic PMI composite data will be out on Wednesday while a slew of economic releases in the US -- including non-farm payrolls, crude oil inventories and ADP non-farm employment, among others -- would also influence market sentiment.  Pankaj Pandey, head of research at ICICI Securities, in an interview with ET Now said, "I think the global-led volatility will keep coming to the market and will keep impacting us. On the domestic side, we are getting a decent sense of numbers. I think with better monsoon, we can expect the Indian market to be far more resilient compared with global markets. But given the recent rally that we have seen (from Fed lows) it is quite possible that the market would take a breather at current level before inching up." </description><link>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/the-week-that-was-realty-banking-tech-stocks-shone-when-boj-earnings-hurt-street/articleshow/52061705.cms</link><guid>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/the-week-that-was-realty-banking-tech-stocks-shone-when-boj-earnings-hurt-street/articleshow/52061705.cms</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 05:53:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Sensex week ahead: Top four events to track in the coming week</title><description>NEW DELHI: The benchmark equity indices closed on a flat note for the week ended on April 29, as the market consolidated in a narrow range for the second consecutive week in a row.  The market requires fresh triggers to either break out or break down from this narrow range. However, the market has better chances of moving higher, which can take the Nifty50 above 8,000-8,100 levels. The Sensex is likely to scale 26,000 in the near term.  The 50-share Nifty now has to hold on to its crucial support level of 7,820 and 7,750 on a closing to sustain the momentum on the upside, while BSE Sensex has to trade above its crucial 200-DMA placed at 25,838.  Here are the top four events investors are going to track in the coming week:  Next batch of Q4 results: Some of the heavyweights that are expected to announce their earnings next week include HDFC, Adani Ports, Adani Power, Century Textiles, Godrej Cons, MRF, HeroMoto, Eicher Motors, MCX and Titan.  On an aggregate basis, net profit reported by 136 companies has plunged 11.6 per cent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 27,846 crore, and 21.85 per cent sequentially, according to ETIG data compiled on Thursday. Total sales rose 5.03 per cent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 2,60,366 crore.  Monthly auto numbers: Auto stocks will remain in focus, as these companies start unveiling monthly sales data for April 2016. The performance of auto companies in March was satisfying, albeit on a low base.  Carmakers such as Maruti grew on new launches. "Exports remained weak, particularly on the two-wheeler side, as unavailability of dollar in most African countries persisted, where two-wheeler volumes are strong," LKP said in a report.  Parliament session: All eyes will be on the political front, as developments in the Budget session of Parliament will be watched closely. The second part of the budget session of Parliament, which commenced last week after a month-long recess, will conclude on May 13.  "The government hopes to receive the support of the Opposition parties in the passage of key legislations, including the Goods &amp; Services Tax (GST) Bill," Vijay Singhania, Founder-Director, Trade Smart Online told ETMarkets.com.  Technical indicators: The market has been moving in a narrow range over the past two weeks and a breakout or a breakdown is imminent, which will define the market trend. The index has been movement in a narrow band over the past two weeks, just about the crucial long-term red channel resistance trend line.  "The breakout of its past two weeks' high and low at 7,992 and 7,788 would decide its next trend. The daily trend shows a negative bias. If it trades below 7,788 level, it would be a negative signal," Birendrakumar Singh, AVP - Technical Research at Systematix Shares &amp; Stocks, told ETMarkets.com.  "If the index starts trading below 7,788, it would be placed below the red channel resistance trend line, which would be a negative. The downward target and support would be at 7,742," he said.  Singh said time wise if the index maintains above 7,516 for next 10 sessions and is able to move decisively above 7,992, its next target and resistance would be at 8,243 which is the 61.8% retracement level of the index's downfall from 9,119-6,825 levels.  </description><link>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sensex-week-ahead-top-four-events-to-track-in-the-coming-week/articleshow/52061323.cms</link><guid>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sensex-week-ahead-top-four-events-to-track-in-the-coming-week/articleshow/52061323.cms</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 05:01:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Indian IT firm Kellton Tech to set up base in Ireland</title><description>LONDON: Indian information technology firm Kellton Tech will set up its headquarters in eastern Ireland that will help create 100 additional jobs in the region.  Hyderabad-based Kellton Tech will set up its EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) headquarters in Drogheda on the east coast of Ireland.  Ireland's minister for jobs, enterprise &amp; innovation, Richard Bruton, made the announcement earlier this week, saying the move will create 100 additional jobs in the region.  "The announcement by Kellton Tech that it is establishing its EMEA HQ in Drogheda, and creating 100 extra jobs is a major boost for the North East and for our regional plans generally," he said.  The Irish headquarters will also house an R&amp;D facility to facilitate the localisation of Kellton's flagship product KLGAME, an IoT uptake using beacons, wearables, smartphones and other digital technologies for revolutionary applications.  "Ireland is home to one of Europe's best multilingual, tech talent pool and will act as our springboard to make inroads into the European market and beyond.  As a pioneer of digital transformation, we are the market leaders in India with strong penetration in US," said Krishna Chintam, co-founder and managing director, Kellton Tech.  "We are happy to extend our expertise to the EMEA market with Ireland as our base. We believe that this region is poised to emerge as our largest revenue-contributor outside of US," he added.  Kellton Tech says it enables businesses to make the digital leap through its broad range of IT offerings with particular focus on ISMAC (Internet of things, Social, Mobile, Analytics, Cloud) and ERP-EAI (Enterprise Resource Planning &amp; Enterprise Application Integration).  "Given that the US region contributes substantially to our revenue, the Ireland office will also be best-equipped to support US operations.  "The language edge and time-difference makes Ireland a highly advantageous proposition for technical support, sales-enablement and accounting. We foresee a huge step-up in our hiring in near-term to support our ambitious growth plans," said Karanjit Singh, CEO, Kellton Tech. </description><link>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/indian-it-firm-kellton-tech-to-set-up-base-in-ireland/articleshow/52052858.cms</link><guid>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/indian-it-firm-kellton-tech-to-set-up-base-in-ireland/articleshow/52052858.cms</guid><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2016 08:48:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>After tepid growth, new plans boost LIC's fresh premium income</title><description>MUMBAI: After recording negative growth in fresh premium income a year ago, LIC returned to a positive path in 2015-16, powered by newly-launched schemes during the year.  The insurance behemoth collected around Rs 31,000 crore in first year premium income in 2015-16 as against Rs 25,000 crore in 2014-15, a senior LIC official told PTI today.  For 2013-14, the first year premium income stood at Rs 30,000 crore.  The state-run corporation has clocked positive sales in number of policies too. It sold around 2.6 crore policies in 2015-16, up from 2 crore policies in 2014-15.  Among the new products launched by LIC in 2015-16, it collected Rs 11,000 crore from Jeewan Labh, whereas another scheme Jeewan Shikhar helped it mop up Rs 2,000 crore during the last fiscal, the official said.  Total new premium includes the mop-up through Varistha Vima Yojana, a special pension scheme launched by the Government for senior citizens.  The corporation had mobilised over Rs 5,000 crore through the scheme that wound up in last June. LIC also mobilised around Rs 4,300 crore through its own pension scheme Jeevan Akshay.  However, unlike the private sector life insurers which have seen substantial contribution to their premium income through Ulip sales, LIC, which had just one such product ( launched in August last), didn't have much income through the scheme. The company could sell merely 11,000 Ulip policies during the year under review.  The corporation managed to show positive performance despite witnessing depletion of its agency force to around 10.5 lakh in the year from 11.63 lakh a year ago.  LIC has lined up 7-8 products, mostly conventional ones, for launch during the current fiscal, he said.  The company posted a profit of Rs 11,000 crore through its equity investments in the just concluded fiscal.  "We saw some profit booking opportunities during the fiscal and made a profit of Rs 11,000 crore through our equity investments in the recently concluded 2015-16.  "In the past few years growth in equity investment has been around 10-15 per cent, which we can achieve even in this financial year," LIC Executive Director (investment operations) Pravin Kutumbe told reporters on the sidelines of an event here recently.  He said the largest domestic investor pumped in Rs 2.7 lakh crore across equity and debt markets in the fiscal, of which Rs 65,000 crore was in the equity segment. </description><link>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/after-tepid-growth-new-plans-boost-lics-fresh-premium-income/articleshow/51784639.cms</link><guid>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/after-tepid-growth-new-plans-boost-lics-fresh-premium-income/articleshow/51784639.cms</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2016 17:21:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Steady economic growth fails to revive job market: Report</title><description> MUMBAI: Notwithstanding the Indian economy's steady growth, sectors such as telecom, engineering and electronics have witnessed a decline in employment rate over the last four years, says a report.  "The economic growth witnessed at the macro-level has not translated into more jobs creation," according to Care Ratings report on 'Employment in the Corporate Sector'.  The industries that witnessed decline in employment growth were telecom, engineering, electronics, packaging and cables, it added.  Care Ratings said the economic growth performance has been impressive but the employment curve has not kept pace with the same.  The report analysed employment data across various sectors as well as industries and is based on a sample of 1,072 companies across various sectors.  Care Ratings opined that jobs need to be created not just to sustain the issue of employment but also add to consumer demand, which has been lagging in the last three years and has to be reversed.  Negative growth under the manufacturing segment was witnessed in electronics (4.5 per cent), engineering (6.6 per cent) and telecommunication (7.9 per cent).  Other sectors that saw a negative growth in FY2014-15 were non-financial services (17.4 per cent), construction (17.1 per cent) and mining (3.8 per cent), the report added.  "Manufacturing in particular has not done too well, while services performed better. The preference for services even for the pool of employable people can distort the demand-supply equation when manufacturing is back on track," it said.  The report revealed that manufacturing had the highest share in employment accounting for more than 40 per cent of jobs creation, followed by banking (23 per cent) and information technology (18.4 per cent), the report said.  This means that the future of job creation would largely be dependent on the growth in the manufacturing sector and the low growth in the last 3 years is a cause for concern, it said.  Financial and other non-financial services together account for 5. 2 per cent share in total employment.  The highest growth rate in jobs were in forgings, consumer foods, IT, breweries and pharmaceuticals. Meanwhile, in 2014-15, IT, banking and financial services were the only sectors to witness positive growth. </description><link>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/steady-economic-growth-fails-to-revive-job-market-report/articleshow/52062947.cms</link><guid>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/steady-economic-growth-fails-to-revive-job-market-report/articleshow/52062947.cms</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 08:27:26 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
